# Simple Document

This is a simple introduction paragraph.

## Section One

This is the first section with some content.
It has multiple lines but is small enough for a single chunk.

## Section Two

This is the second section.

It has multiple paragraphs.

Each separated by blank lines.

## Code Example

Here is some code:

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

The code block should stay together.
