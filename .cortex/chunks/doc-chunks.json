Assume they are an experienced architect who wants to think through problems, not receive lectures. Never explain basic concepts unless explicitly asked.\n\n**Direct and concise:** Get straight to the hard questions and interesting problems. Skip formalities, verbose explanations, and over-structured responses. Use brief, pointed questions that advance the conversation.\n\n**Exploration over documentation:** During architectural brainstorming:\n- Focus on conversation, not creating formal documents\n- Ask hard questions about edge cases, performance, scaling, failure modes\n- Identify potential gotchas and trade-offs\n- Challenge assumptions constructively\n- Only create documentation when explicitly

implement)\n- Explaining what the user already knows\n- Over-structured responses with multiple sections/headers\n- Verbose summaries of what was just discussed\n- AVOID epxlaining things with code - unless it is truly necessary - THIS IS A STRATEGIC CONVERSATION - WE SPEAK IN INTERFACES AND ABSRACTIONS MOST OF THE TIME - WALLS OF CODE ARE NOT HELPFUL!!!!!\n- Do NOT write impelmentation code in the chat unless specifically asked to do so - we are talking about architecture as architects and showing detailed code generally gets in the way - if needed we might disucss a specific interface or data structure - or the user may ask for specific code but if they do not ask DO NOT explain by showing code - think like an architect talking to another architect - high level strategic conversations\n\n**Mode transitions:**\n- Brainstorming → Ask questions, identify problems, think through trade-offs\n- Ready to document → Create architecture docs capturing decisions and open

proper service boundaries\n- Event-driven architecture (EDA) with event sourcing and CQRS\n- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with bounded contexts and ubiquitous language\n- Serverless architecture patterns and Function-as-a-Service design\n- API-first design with ConnectRPC best practices\n- Layered architecture with proper separation of concerns\n\n### Distributed Systems Design\n- Service mesh architecture with Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect\n- Event streaming with Redis Streams, Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, and NATS\n- Distributed data patterns including Saga, Outbox, and Event Sourcing\n- Circuit breaker, bulkhead, and timeout patterns for resilience\n- Distributed caching strategies with Redis Cluster and Hazelcast\n- Load balancing and service discovery patterns\n- Distributed tracing and observability architecture\n\n### SOLID Principles \u0026 Design Patterns\n- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution principles\n- Interface Segregation and

Practices (Go 1.25+)**\n   - Proper use of generics where appropriate\n   - Idiomatic error handling (errors.Is, errors.As, wrapped errors)\n   - Context propagation and cancellation\n   - Effective use of interfaces and composition over inheritance\n   - Proper goroutine lifecycle management and synchronization\n   - Appropriate use of channels vs. mutexes\n   - Memory efficiency and avoiding unnecessary allocations\n   - Proper use of defer, panic, and recover\n\n2. **Cloud-Native Best Practices**\n   - 12-factor app compliance\n   - Proper configuration management (environment variables,

.claude/agents/go-code-reviewer.md (section 3)","text":"3. **Security Best Practices**\n   - Input validation and sanitization\n   - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)\n   - Proper authentication and authorization checks\n   - Secure credential management (no hardcoded secrets)\n   - TLS/HTTPS usage\n   - Rate limiting and DoS protection\n   - Proper use of crypto packages (crypto/rand, not math/rand for security)\n   - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability prevention\n   - Dependency vulnerability scanning awareness\n   - Proper error messages (no sensitive data leakage)\n\n4. **Test Coverage and Quality**\n   - Presence of unit tests for all public functions\n   - Table-driven tests where appropriate\n   - Proper use of testing.T methods\n   - Test coverage for error paths and edge cases\n   - Integration tests for external dependencies\n   - No TODO comments in test files\n   - Tests actually execute (no skipped or commented-out tests)\n   - Proper test isolation and cleanup\n   - Use of testify or similar assertion libraries appropriately\n   - Benchmark tests for performance-critical code\n\n5. **Code Quality Issues**\n   - Duplicate code blocks that should be

and stable?\n- Is the public interface pattern correctly implemented?\n- Are layer boundaries respected (no infrastructure in domain logic)?\n- Are dependencies pointing in the correct direction?\n\n**Failure Modes:**\n- What happens when this code fails? Is it safe?\n- Are error paths properly tested?\n- Is context cancellation respected?\n- Are resources properly cleaned up on all paths?\n\n**Scalability \u0026 Performance:**\n- Will this code scale under load?\n- Are there obvious bottlenecks or N+1 queries?\n- Is connection pooling used appropriately?\n- Are allocations reasonable for hot paths?\n\n**Concurrency Safety:**\n- Are race conditions

.claude/agents/go-code-reviewer.md (section 5)","text":"## Review Process\n\nWhen reviewing code:\n\n1. **Context Loading**:\n   - Read project docs (CLAUDE.md, coding-conventions.md, testing docs)\n   - Understand what changed and why (git diff, commit messages)\n   - Identify the architectural layer (API, service, repository, etc.)\n\n2. **Initial Scan**:\n   - Assess overall structure and identify purpose\n   - Note immediate red flags (security, correctness, architecture)\n   - Check if changes align with project patterns\n\n3. **Systematic Analysis**: Review each file methodically:\n   - Public interface pattern compliance\n   - Error handling consistency (ConnectRPC vs standard)\n   - Proper layer separation\n   - Concurrency and resource management\n   - Test coverage and quality\n\n4. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Look for system-wide patterns:\n   - Architectural boundary violations\n   - Security vulnerabilities spanning files\n   - Repeated code needing abstraction\n

Assume the developer is experienced and made thoughtful choices. Ask about intent before assuming mistakes.\n\n**Direct and focused:** Get to the important issues. Skip trivial style preferences. Focus on security, correctness, architecture, and testability.\n\n**Explain the why:** Don't just point out problems—explain their impact on production systems, maintenance burden, or future developers.\n\n**Balance rigor with pragmatism:** Distinguish between \"must fix\" (security, correctness) and \"nice to have\" (style, minor refactors).

Assume they're even more experienced than you and can provide valuable insights. If you need to epxlain something to the user, assume they are very experienced, and skip basic explanations unless explicitly asked.\n\n**Direct and concise:** Get straight to implementation challenges and interesting problems. Skip formalities, verbose explanations, and over-structured responses.\n\n**Think strategically before coding:** Before implementing, ask yourself and explore:\n- What's the failure mode here?\n- How does this scale?\n- What are the concurrency implications?\n- Where are the boundaries between components?\n- What abstractions make this testable and maintainable?\n\n**Design before implementation:**\n- Start with interfaces and contracts\n- Think about data flow and state management\n- Consider error paths and edge cases\n- Identify integration points and dependencies\n- Only

abstraction layers?\n- How do components communicate?\n- What dependencies exist between packages?\n\n**Failure Modes:**\n- What breaks when this service goes down?\n- How do we handle partial failures?\n- What's the retry/timeout strategy?\n- Where do we need circuit breakers?\n\n**Concurrency \u0026 State:**\n- What's shared and how is it protected?\n- Where do race conditions emerge?\n- How do we coordinate goroutines?\n- What's the cancellation strategy?\n\n**Scalability:**\n- What's the bottleneck?\n- How does this perform under load?\n- Where do we need connection pooling?\n-

errors up the stack to appropriate handling levels\n- Use sentinel errors or custom types for errors that callers must handle specifically\n- Never ignore errors without explicit justification\n\n**Context Management:**\n- Always pass `context.Context` as first parameter for I/O operations\n- Propagate cancellation through the call stack\n- Use context for request-scoped values sparingly and carefully\n- Respect context deadlines and cancellation signals\n\n**Concurrency:**\n- Use goroutines and channels idiomatically\n- Prefer `sync.WaitGroup`, `errgroup.Group`, or context cancellation for coordination\n- Avoid shared mutable state; use channels or sync primitives when necessary\n- Consider `sync.Once` for one-time initialization\n- Be mindful of goroutine leaks\n\n**Generics:**\n- Use generics to improve type safety and reduce duplication\n- Don't over-abstract; prefer specific types when generics add complexity\n- Good use cases: container types, data structure utilities, functional patterns\n\n**Package Design:**\n- Clear boundaries with minimal circular dependencies\n- Use internal packages to hide implementation details\n- Export only what's necessary; keep implementation types unexported\n- Follow the public interface pattern with unexported

functions that return interfaces, not concrete types\n- Pass dependencies through function parameters or struct fields\n\n**Structured Logging:**\n- Use `log/slog` with appropriate log levels\n-

Review CLAUDE.md files or project documentation for coding conventions\n2. **Read docs/coding-conventions.md** for specific patterns:\n   - Public interface pattern with unexported implementations\n   - ConnectRPC error handling with `connect.NewError()`\n   - Structured logging with `log/slog`\n   - Repository patterns and layer separation\n3. **Read docs/testing-best-practices.md** for the 6-step TDD workflow:\n   - Write test plan as comments\n   - Plan test cases (including edge cases)\n   - Think of a general solution (not just code that passes tests)\n   - Review \u0026 iterate on test cases\n   - Implement test cases one-by-one, ensuring each passes\n   - Review code for correctness, design, readability, consistency\n4. **Read docs/testing-strategy.md** for testing layers and goals\n5.

related functionality into cohesive packages\n- Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns\n- Think in layers: domain, application, infrastructure\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- Provide context when wrapping errors\n- Handle errors at appropriate architectural boundaries\n- Return errors rather than panicking except in truly exceptional circumstances\n- Consider custom error types for domain-specific failures\n\n**Testing:**\n- **Write tests as you implement** following the 6-step TDD workflow (docs/testing-best-practices.md)\n- Start with test plan as comments, then implement tests one-by-one\n- Table-driven tests for functions with multiple cases\n- Always use `t.Parallel()` when safe\n- Use testify (`require` for setup/preconditions, `assert` for validation)\n- Test failure scenarios, edge cases, and concurrency\n- Mock external dependencies using interfaces (when necessary)\n- High coverage of business logic and critical paths\n\n**Performance:**\n- Be mindful

(NEVER use `cat`, `head`, `tail`)\n- **Write tool**: For creating new files (NEVER use `cat \u003c\u003cEOF`, `echo \u003e`, or heredocs)\n- **Edit tool**: For modifying existing files (NEVER use `sed`, `awk`, or in-place edits)\n- **Glob tool**: For finding files by pattern (NEVER use `find` or `ls`)\n- **Grep tool**: For searching file contents (NEVER use `grep` or `rg`)\n- **Bash tool**: ONLY for actual system commands like `go build`, `go test`, `git`, etc.\n\nUsing bash for file operations provides a poor user experience and violates tool usage

Ask about:\n   - Expected behavior and contracts\n   - Error handling and failure scenarios\n   - Performance constraints and scaling needs\n   - Integration points and dependencies\n\n2. **Think Architecturally**: Before coding:\n   - Identify system boundaries and interfaces\n   - Design data flow and state management\n   - Consider failure modes and edge cases\n   - Plan testing strategy\n\n3. **Design Interfaces First**:\n   - Define contracts before implementations\n   - Use Go interfaces to express abstractions\n   - Consider testability and mockability\n   - Think about future extensibility\n\n4. **Implement with Tests** (TDD workflow from docs/testing-best-practices.md):\n   - Write test plan as comments in test file\n   - Plan all test cases (including edge cases)\n   - Implement the general solution (not just code that passes tests)\n   - Review and add any missing test cases\n   - Implement test cases one-by-one, ensuring each passes\n   - Review code for correctness, design, readability, consistency\n\n5. **Self-Review**: Before presenting:\n   - Verify it compiles and runs\n   - Check for common issues (error handling, resource leaks, race

describe --tags --abbrev=0\n\n# Get commits since last tag (with full messages for analysis)\ngit log \u003clast-tag\u003e..HEAD --format=\"%H|%s|%b\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Commits and Suggest Version\n\nAnalyze the commits to determine the appropriate semver bump:\n\n- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes, API changes (look for \"BREAKING CHANGE:\" in commit body or \"!\")\n- **Minor (0.x.0)**: New features, enhancements (commits starting with \"feat:\", \"add:\", or \"Add\")\n- **Patch (0.0.x)**: Bug fixes, documentation, refactoring (commits starting with \"fix:\", \"docs:\", \"refactor:\", \"perf:\")\n\nUse AskUserQuestion to prompt for the version number. Present options:\n- Patch bump (e.g., v1.2.0 → v1.2.1)\n- Minor bump (e.g., v1.2.0 → v1.3.0)\n- Major bump (e.g., v1.2.0 → v2.0.0)\n- Custom (allow user to specify exact version)\n\nIn the question description, include your analysis of the commits and recommendation.\n\n### Step 3: Generate Release Notes\n\nParse the commits and generate release notes in this

.claude/commands/release.md (section 2)","text":"**Formatting rules**:\n- Remove conventional commit prefixes (feat:, fix:, etc.) from the lines\n- Capitalize first letter\n- Keep descriptions concise but clear\n- Group related changes together\n- Omit sections that have no commits\n\n### Step 4: Create and Push Tag\n\nCreate an annotated git tag with the release notes:\n\n```bash\ngit tag -a v\u003cversion\u003e -m \"\u003crelease notes\u003e\"\n```\n\nUse a HEREDOC for the tag message to handle multi-line release notes properly.\n\nThen push the tag:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin v\u003cversion\u003e\n```\n\n### Step 5: Update README.md\n\nUpdate the install instructions in README.md (around line 45) to replace `@latest` with the specific version:\n\n```bash\n# Current format (with @latest):\ngo install github.com/mvp-joe/project-cortex/cmd/cortex@latest\n\n# Should become:\ngo install github.com/mvp-joe/project-cortex/cmd/cortex@v\u003cnew-version\u003e\n```\n\nUse the Edit tool to replace `@latest` with `@v\u003cnew-version\u003e`.\n\n**Why**: This ensures the README always shows the current stable version. Users who want the absolute latest can still use `@latest`, but the documented default is the last known-good release.\n\n### Step 6: Commit and Push README Change\n\n```bash\ngit add README.md\ngit

CLAUDE.md (section 1)","text":"## Project Overview\n\nProject Cortex is a dual-binary Go application that enables deep semantic search of **both code and documentation** for LLM-powered coding assistants. It consists of:\n\n1. **cortex** - Main CLI for indexing code/docs and running MCP server\n2. **cortex-embed** (~300MB) - Embedding service with embedded Python runtime\n\nThe architecture follows a three-phase pipeline:\n- **Indexing**: Parse code (tree-sitter) + docs → Extract structured knowledge → Chunk → Embed → Store as JSON\n- **Storage**: Git-friendly JSON chunk files in `.cortex/chunks/` (version controlled)\n- **Serving**: MCP server loads chunks into in-memory vector DB (chromem-go) for semantic

CLAUDE.md (section 2)","text":"## Using the Cortex Search MCP Tool\n\n**IMPORTANT**: When working with this project, use the `mcp__project-cortex__cortex_search` tool as your **starting point** for understanding code, architecture, and design decisions. This semantic search tool searches both code and documentation together using vector embeddings.\n\n### When to Use Semantic Search\n\n**Use `mcp__project-cortex__cortex_search` for:**\n- Understanding \"why\" something was built a certain way (architecture, design decisions)\n- Finding code by concept/functionality (not just exact text matching)\n- Discovering what exists and where (navigation)\n- Understanding how features work end-to-end (combining docs + code)\n- Finding configuration values, constants, defaults\n\n**Don't use for:**\n- Exact text/identifier searches (use Grep instead)\n- Listing all files (use Glob/file system tools)\n- Reading specific known files (use Read tool)\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n```typescript\nmcp__project-cortex__cortex_search({\n  query:

Patterns\n\n#### 1. Understanding Architecture/Design\n\n```typescript\n// Find design rationale and decisions\nmcp__project-cortex__cortex_search({\n  query: \"why was authentication implemented this way\",\n  chunk_types: [\"documentation\"],\n  limit: 10\n})\n```\n\n#### 2. Code Navigation\n\n```typescript\n// Find code structure and signatures\nmcp__project-cortex__cortex_search({\n  query: \"authentication handler implementation\",\n  chunk_types: [\"symbols\", \"definitions\"]\n})\n```\n\n#### 3. Finding Configuration\n\n```typescript\n// Discover constants and default values\nmcp__project-cortex__cortex_search({\n  query: \"database connection settings\",\n  chunk_types: [\"data\"]\n})\n```\n\n#### 4. Complete Context (Default)\n\n```typescript\n// Get full picture: docs + code\nmcp__project-cortex__cortex_search({\n  query: \"how does hot reload work\",\n  limit: 20\n  // No filters = search all chunk types\n})\n```\n\n#### 5.

CLAUDE.md (section 2)","text":"### How Filtering Works\n\n- **`chunk_types`**: OR logic within array. `[\"symbols\", \"definitions\"]` returns chunks matching ANY type.\n- **`tags`**: AND logic. `[\"go\", \"code\"]` returns chunks with BOTH tags.\n- **Empty arrays**: No filtering (search all).\n\n### Performance\n\nTypical query: ~60-110ms (50-100ms embedding + \u003c10ms vector search)\n\n### Return Format\n\nResults include structured data with metadata:\n- File paths (relative to project root)\n- Line numbers (start_line, end_line)\n- Chunk type, tags, language\n-

CLAUDE.md (section 5)","text":"## High-Level Architecture\n\n### Three-Tier Code Extraction\n\nCode is extracted at three granularity levels, each stored as separate JSON chunk files:\n\n1. **Symbols** (`code-symbols.json`): High-level file overview\n   - Package/module name, import count, type/function names with line numbers\n   - Natural language format: \"Package: server\\n\\nTypes:\\n  - Handler (struct) (lines 10-15)\"\n   - Use for: Quick navigation, understanding file structure\n\n2. **Definitions** (`code-definitions.json`): Full signatures without implementations\n   - Complete type definitions, interfaces, function signatures with comments\n   - Actual code format with line comments: \"// Lines 10-15\\ntype Handler struct {...}\"\n   - Use for: Understanding contracts, APIs, type relationships\n\n3. **Data** (`code-data.json`): Constants and configuration\n   - Constant declarations, global variables, enum values, defaults\n   - Actual code format with line comments\n   - Use for: Configuration discovery, finding default values\n\n### Documentation Chunking\n\nDocumentation (`doc-chunks.json`) is semantically chunked by headers with line tracking:\n- Split at `##` headers when possible (preserves topic coherence)\n- Falls back to paragraph splitting for large sections\n- Never splits inside code blocks\n- Metadata includes

CLAUDE.md (section 5)","text":"```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"unique-identifier\",\n  \"chunk_type\": \"symbols|definitions|data|documentation\",\n  \"title\": \"Human-readable title\",\n  \"text\": \"Natural language formatted content\",\n  \"embedding\": [0.123, -0.456, ...],\n  \"tags\": [\"code\", \"go\", \"symbols\"],\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"source\": \"code|markdown\",\n    \"file_path\":

than `{\"package\": \"server\"}`.\n\n### Embedding Provider Interface\n\nBoth indexer and MCP server use a shared provider interface (`internal/embed/provider.go`):\n\n```go\ntype Provider interface {\n    Embed(ctx context.Context, texts []string, mode EmbedMode) ([][]float32, error)\n    Dimensions() int\n    Close() error\n}\n\ntype EmbedMode string\nconst (\n    EmbedModeQuery   EmbedMode = \"query\"   // For search queries\n    EmbedModePassage EmbedMode = \"passage\" // For document chunks\n)\n```\n\n**Implementations**:\n- `LocalProvider` (internal/embed/local.go): Manages cortex-embed binary, auto-starts if needed\n- Future: `OpenAIProvider`, `AnthropicProvider`\n\n**Factory pattern** (internal/embed/factory.go): `embed.NewProvider(config)` returns

Receive MCP request → Generate query embedding (via provider) → Vector similarity search → Filter by chunk_types/tags → Return results\n3. **Hot Reload**: Watch `.cortex/chunks/` → Debounce 500ms → Rebuild collection → Swap atomically\n\n**Composable tool registration pattern**:\n\n```go\nfunc AddCortexSearchTool(s *server.MCPServer, searcher ContextSearcher)\n```\n\nAllows combining multiple MCP tools in one server.\n\n**Tool interface**: `cortex_search` with filters for chunk_types and tags (AND logic).\n\n### Incremental Indexing\n\nTracks file changes via SHA-256 checksums (`.cortex/generator-output.json`):\n- Only reprocess changed files\n- Merge new chunks with unchanged chunks\n- Atomic writes (temp → rename) to prevent MCP server seeing partial state\n- Chunk IDs stable for unchanged files (no unnecessary embedding regeneration)\n\n### Atomic Write Strategy\n\n**Problem**: MCP server watches chunk directory; must never read partial writes.\n\n**Solution**: Write to `.cortex/chunks/.tmp/\u003cfile\u003e.json` → Rename (atomic POSIX operation).\n\n**Benefits**: MCP-safe, crash recovery, hot reload friendly (single fsnotify event).","embedding":[-0.106264554,-0.021640701,0.007839163,-0.020721544,-0.0068774684,-0.025896939,-0.013482552,-0.02779675,0.023249343,-0.00244786,0.060591746,-0.043558635,0.022787008,0.024881156,0.004564153,-0.020953393,-0.029409258,-0.013942596,0.025583489,-0.04371166,-0.013660938,0.02113631,-0.011031687,-0.017001744,-0.016280204,0.057427134,0.004819401,-0.043808907,-0.045442127,-0.24272004,0.016445743,-0.041431986,0.025583288,-0.057001356,-0.008117807,-0.0045799813,0.045381185,0.014372976,-0.0035284034,0.054315824,0.02269427,0.02184469,-0.047186073,0.005183953,0.023354465,-0.0015986672,0.06562522,-0.010444944,0.04505995,0.011990309,-0.030428465,-0.02395,-0.0068995347,-0.0026844658,0.00039892932,0.057328526,0.050857946,0.053727686,0.016501242,0.01764585,0.036530603,0.026305716,-0.10163926,0.06644574,0.06746222,0.0540108,-0.033556692,-0.020042995,-0.016315097,0.048636355,-0.05039442,0.06621999,0.019871721,0.07011578,-0.0047700484,-0.06643406,-0.011457798,0.016058119,0.01647677,-0.001430706,-0.09082983,0.00944028,0.0044259387,-0.019671706,0.01391412,0.021421608,-0.026474522,0.018888436,0.017436594,-0.048351932,0.0027120977,-0.020999838,-0.009110499,-0.0051278607,-0.092870615,0.031537663,0.018561563,0.06716825,0.025503872,0.364366,-0.007873973,0.055472527,-0.034788802,-0.000651806,0.0008903562,-0.027623283,0.045878284,0.040613417,-0.0037014254,-0.0050446633,0.0050176345,-0.038704935,0.026263349,-0.056980245,0.0072537777,-0.02776143,-0.0007424168,0.03069517,-0.05236033,0.03816231,-0.013245595,-0.005293868,0.013580091,0.02718108,0.054011703,-0.01314113,0.036192395,0.040831577,0.03166505,0.0010174591,0.01548977,0.039388508,-0.028917715,-0.013068654,0.023932619,0.021244446,-0.032066863,-0.06413059,0.044002455,-0.022916356,0.0006133057,0.05314437,0.031369966,-0.06200608,0.001652892,0.12621167,-0.021009825,0.0046012364,-0.02498291,-0.089333646,-0.01694202,0.022804637,0.016765105,-0.057468977,-0.041812863,0.017116006,0.0016501567,0.0049368693,-0.055506997,-0.03585177,-0.06921537,-0.045347992,0.0327674,0.076297514,0.04106734,-0.077745244,0.050393667,0.03452159,-0.064474575,-0.047724675,-0.023682246,0.0053149574,0.00621736,-0.06965014,0.016757185,-0.04321991,-0.10622865,0.0136386845,0.03633277,-0.028048297,0.030166874,-0.01580546,0.00454625,-0.014793162,-0.05376517,-0.06828901,-0.03988628,0.007033332,-0.009750086,0.028248468,-0.051151995,-0.013832149,0.016798379,0.0066280765,-0.011925421,-0.042296365,0.017699506,0.035736736,0.0301733,-0.04557061,0.09688196,0.02814482,-0.040420245,0.04546269,-0.015993169,-0.018911265,-0.0402748,0.018221943,0.006727687,-0.026937518,-0.032583445,0.015681425,-0.040468175,0.025505442,-0.018002475,-0.047960944,0.026504366,0.029744973,0.012888305,0.09214165,-0.03790914,-0.0154713355,-0.016440563,-0.3341417,-0.020721069,0.027534937,0.031351484,0.04791251,-0.08127241,0.019101327,-0.003644624,-0.007130001,-0.0050669247,0.0861972,-0.00872102,-0.043016598,-0.04149693,-0.009725206,-0.0038987205,0.025705421,-0.04278086,-0.009641785,0.012142171,0.037816152,0.036541134,0.0110060815,-0.046142317,0.06504628,0.00030115587,0.0737998,0.015871413,0.019306557,-0.091086045,-0.062167924,0.058507208,-0.0021636789,-0.08306371,-0.0213566,0.012119039,0.032624383,0.02049322,0.031708773,0.016895281,-0.044628907,-0.006204979,-0.014517512,-0.07877609,-0.03506988,-0.04269032,-0.0059094527,-0.010332471,0.038523182,0.0056979842,-0.04243558,0.017902952,-0.0030377735,0.016825229,0.009191762,0.0055404236,-0.048285455,-0.024480943,-0.045044295,-0.006876014,0.067194834,-0.018459491,-0.025460342,-0.05499705,0.0730574,-0.018112948,0.05727327,0.04969495,0.022163725,-0.029432066,-0.03311144,0.05638824,-0.01739521,0.045031168,-0.0077963253,0.029350897,-0.039605994,-0.07898414,-0.022995126,-0.036647573,0.064358935,0.047747437,0.024144555,-0.026124686,0.0048052995,0.013153869,0.028401721,0.020349707,-0.0035927054,-0.0035230238,0.01576008,-0.041820265,-0.04019675,-0.011079523,0.066057116,0.017557414,-0.2865171,0.023392066,-0.0027831674,-0.0001917832,0.021945776,0.014899607,0.010983303,-0.033276163,0.009585365,0.020085879,-0.021547526,0.041881613,0.044924326,0.029629095,0.008061657,0.052472435,0.055560686,0.0076624365,0.025106965,-0.029670088,0.03809509,0.004023357,0.20905821,-0.012721227,0.01639639,0.007922577,0.039120268,0.00872883,0.06539213,0.011065711,0.06007976,-0.073075674,0.053462006,0.0059315595,0.053889826,0.08224395,0.046131574,0.04158125,-0.0006692383,0.009104956,-0.01304522,0.008826224,-0.029486086,0.03678114,0.016459918,-0.065499514,-0.04423102,-0.029100372,-0.047001082,-0.028835882,-0.05216295,-0.040197797,0.031255737,-0.011856794,-0.02331234,0.029307572,-0.053534053,-0.0065382444,-0.029832542,0.052468237,0.09249848,0.013952662,0.054223202,0.080916,-0.009129444],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":2,"end_line":347,"file_path":"CLAUDE.md","section_index":5,"source":"markdown","start_line":321,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"created_at":"2025-10-28T22:06:13.359676-06:00","updated

CLAUDE.md (section 7)","text":"## Code Conventions\n\n### Public Interface Pattern\n\nAll major components use **public interfaces with unexported implementations**:\n\n```go\n// Public interface in internal/embed/provider.go\ntype Provider interface {\n    Embed(ctx context.Context, texts []string, mode EmbedMode) ([][]float32, error)\n    Dimensions() int\n    Close() error\n}\n\n// Public constructor returns interface\nfunc NewProvider(config Config) (Provider, error) {\n    return \u0026localProvider{config: config}, nil\n}\n\n// Unexported implementation in internal/embed/local.go\ntype localProvider struct {\n    config Config\n}\n```\n\n**Benefits**: Encapsulation, testability, interface-driven development, easy mocking.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nUse standard Go error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w`:\n\n```go\nif err != nil {\n    return fmt.Errorf(\"failed to parse file: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// Custom error types for errors.Is()\nvar ErrUnsupportedLanguage = errors.New(\"unsupported language\")\n```\n\nFor MCP protocol errors, return Go errors—mcp-go handles JSON-RPC error codes.\n\n### Logging\n\nUse standard `log` package for CLI output:\n\n```go\nlog.Printf(\"Indexing %d files...\", fileCount)\nlog.Printf(\"✓ Generated %d chunks\", chunkCount)\nlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to start MCP server: %v\", err)\n```\n\nKeep CLI output clean and user-friendly.

- Use real dependencies where possible (avoid excessive mocking)\n\n2. **Integration tests** (`*_integration_test.go`): Test component interactions\n   - Indexer end-to-end (parse → chunk → embed → write)\n   - MCP server (load chunks → search)\n   - File watcher hot reload\n   - Use real cortex-embed binary and chromem-go\n   - Tagged with `//go:build integration` to separate from unit tests\n\n3. **E2E tests** (`tests/e2e/`): Test complete CLI workflows\n   - `cortex index` on test project → validate chunk files\n   - `cortex mcp` → query → validate results\n   - Watch mode with file changes\n\n4. **MCP protocol tests** (`internal/mcp/`): Validate MCP compliance\n   - Tool registration and schema\n   - Request/response serialization\n   - Error codes per MCP spec\n\n### Test Tools\n\n- **testify**: Assertions and mocking\n- **t.TempDir()**: Isolated test environments\n- **tree-sitter**: Official Go bindings\n- **mcp-go**: Protocol testing utilities\n- **chromem-go**:

structured data with metadata (file paths, line numbers)\n- `embedding` field excluded via custom JSON marshaler (reduces payload ~60%)\n- Return via `mcp.NewToolResultText(jsonString)` (mcp-go convention)\n\n### Thread Safety (MCP Server)\n\nUse `sync.RWMutex` around searcher:\n- Queries acquire read lock (concurrent)\n- Hot reload acquires write lock (blocks queries briefly, ~100-500ms)\n\n### Debouncing (Hot Reload)\n\nIndexer writes 4 files in rapid succession (~50-200ms apart).

CLAUDE.md (section 12)","text":"## Gotchas and Pitfalls\n\n1. **Python deps platform-specific**: Must generate for target platform before building cortex-embed. Use `task python:deps:\u003cplatform\u003e`.\n\n2. **Atomic writes required**: Always use temp → rename pattern when writing chunks. MCP server watches directory.\n\n3. **Embedding mode matters**: Use `EmbedModePassage` for documents, `EmbedModeQuery` for searches. Wrong mode degrades search quality.\n\n4. **Natural language formatting**: The `text` field in chunks should be natural language, not JSON. Embeddings understand \"Package: auth\\n\\nTypes:\\n  - Handler\" better than structured data.\n\n5. **Chunk ID stability**: IDs include file path. Unchanged files preserve IDs (no re-embedding). File moves/renames trigger full reprocessing.\n\n6. **MCP hot reload**: If indexer writes fail mid-update, server keeps old state until next successful reload. Design is resilient to partial failures.\n\n7. **Chunk types vs tags**: `chunk_types` is structural (symbols/definitions/data/documentation). `tags` is contextual (language, path, custom). Filters use AND logic.\n\n8. **Vector search multiplier**: Fetch 2x limit from vector search before filtering to ensure enough post-filter

Cortex\n\n**Make your AI coding assistant literally smarter.**\n\nProject Cortex provides deep semantic understanding of **both code and documentation** to LLM-powered coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and others. By parsing, indexing, and chunking your code and docs into a searchable vector database, it enables AI assistants to grasp not just what the code does, but why it exists—surfacing architectural decisions, design patterns, and team knowledge that lives in documentation.","embedding":[-0.08365206,0.028731685,-0.004336493,-0.03314593,0.028595706,-0.016460594,0.04478537,0.020883076,-0.013486483,0.006251177,0.025142562,0.0046012625,0.03814013,0.053826034,0.0137338545,-0.0014071341,-0.034474745,0.07289468,0.03976293,-0.0016653874,0.008035472,-0.03774454,-0.020019982,0.036778923,-0.07278825,0.059551597,-0.03857093,-0.07000656,-0.03283034,-0.19308922,0.011293368,0.04715954,0.10085571,-0.0034144435,0.01930022,0.016297052,-0.037415594,0.042936698,0.016292699,-0.0033689043,-0.011330041,-0.023298072,0.01891438,-0.0066260574,0.039152168,-0.0321249,0.026722072,-0.047392406,-0.024164654,0.02462579,0.013874293,-0.009623733,-0.02633213,0.01834823,-0.034369696,0.032084778,0.0021859773,0.0880122,0.06848655,0.027168766,0.050735306,0.011853724,-0.09612658,0.07135442,0.030675877,0.0329516,-0.07664557,-0.0875256,0.02124795,0.078930475,-0.0017042835,0.031992175,0.023928473,0.035687856,0.093685806,0.031697735,-0.00044999577,-0.028772015,0.053908113,-0.04445431,-0.070362635,0.01887286,-0.054471966,0.004483994,0.00055334944,0.038147096,-0.03382221,0.022623943,0.01467631,-0.039512586,-0.03128494,-0.035898678,-0.0583083,0.024205565,-0.008361924,0.017699372,0.0014798932,-0.01461946,-0.056549333,0.37028354,-0.0432755,-0.054273177,-0.016576212,-0.044103313,-0.026444519,-0.069137715,0.04854817,-0.011711738,-0.025538852,0.008785813,-0.03844769,0.035801105,-0.038771033,-0.009339539,0.04647683,-0.024035422,0.038060762,0.028629163,0.005091767,0.0035013473,0.02672145,0.00320472,-0.031864084,-0.004266267,-0.043116074,-0.000496973,0.01704059,0.07096775,0.007791333,0.013995442,0.054597124,0.04970189,-0.07063981,0.05255404,0.038036186,-0.008107949,-0.015375903,-0.00111003,-0.05348602,-0.045574736,0.003928856,0.112523526,0.023917874,0.008622876,-0.072028905,0.06775746,-0.017062508,-0.008732655,-0.015162163,-0.04956401,0.015604668,0.042873647,-0.022103542,-0.021914935,-0.012798727,0.0020558552,0.037366085,-0.041733485,-0.042363506,-0.016036,0.013268914,-0.05371774,-0.029020814,0.069903485,-0.01719501,-0.09421816,0.04057442,-0.012451815,0.0030915139,-0.032582097,0.021956043,-0.0061663417,0.012731284,-0.032094624,-0.0080397185,-0.0028179295,-0.060389135,0.029674474,0.023176216,0.03681547,0.02129255,-0.055471644,0.037691157,0.0023368641,-0.031600494,-0.05727174,0.031532418,-0.058653876,-0.06168508,-0.08315164,-0.0020803697,0.0853493,-0.00034335663,0.04060171,0.03588997,-0.007642179,0.014677119,-0.0065350384,-0.08535733,-0.015391661,-0.060986377,0.015480424,-0.007737094,0.064857684,0.029013824,-0.05490716,0.01662092,-0.033287868,0.015306674,0.029167486,-0.07601808,-0.020134091,0.055582166,-0.000597185,-0.039498474,0.033303734,-0.00330598,0.069960065,-0.027342394,0.056259308,-0.0069698524,0.009581062,0.014734958,-0.29263237,-0.010236882,-0.008609044,-0.016362894,-0.05469362,-0.10390266,0.007859591,-0.033989772,-0.019374577,0.033119917,0.09688344,-0.056968518,-0.018861271,-0.03944211,-0.030382868,0.023685377,0.045672093,0.01644551,-0.015494624,0.000108318316,0.010915171,0.050649427,0.03700676,-0.076724395,0.0036932984,0.011276027,0.110226706,-0.060764756,0.09447815,0.044327166,-0.057661403,0.07584094,0.054202948,-0.12440372,0.045175914,-0.022578623,0.020113412,0.0112270415,0.00095083396,-0.059926532,-0.04740841,-0.012664899,0.001999706,-0.06686512,-0.0478532,0.020692129,-0.011885173,-0.069042474,-0.04473746,-0.0075949365,-0.059178952,0.031984776,-0.03893409,0.028976725,-0.05571454,0.02055276,-0.029827464,0.027045684,-0.033152793,0.03934237,0.0030079153,-0.042062256,-0.04103819,-0.021353416,0.07507702,0.005271968,0.021202985,-0.010905059,0.060095668,0.029159173,-0.0055117155,0.13684428,0.005447845,-0.02054757,0.038553856,0.0005429169,0.02533853,-0.0010567321,0.0064061084,0.031499576,0.07637532,0.044752333,0.019588137,-0.043099906,0.052015968,0.00921287,0.019257924,-0.015425941,0.039568186,0.069535956,0.007845339,0.031900026,-0.019655198,-0.043382823,0.04766013,0.0119091505,-0.23219363,0.037128262,0.04614084,0.014844704,-0.030857863,0.0030070967,-0.003660602,-0.102962025,0.026633529,-0.01472303,-0.022657206,0.02617817,0.002397872,-0.007502944,0.010470847,-0.009593249,0.118563354,-0.04240098,0.061931297,-0.012324274,0.014005245,0.049206313,0.15553305,-0.0017190261,0.010944301,-0.015497067,0.007884376,-0.07623612,0.041311555,0.015893327,-0.009319268,-0.036488835,0.06322025,0.0380153,0.0067045293,0.0727901,-0.029096253,0.004999525,0.023747379,0.019846048,0.051662143,0.012828726,-0.04583475,-0.016044425,0.040679656,0.03921237,-0.054453164,-0.016031232,-0.06646165,-0.031235682,-0.004411393,-0.044232134,-0.022405818,-0.04299592,-0.011337069,0.014891895,-0.028427716,-0.019370377,-0.005648135,-0.0032401083,0.040212594,-0.066740036,0.07133723,0.029856987,-0.024149496],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":0,"end_line":10,"file_path":"README.md","section_index":0,"source":"markdown","start_line":1,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"created_at":"2025-10-28T22:06:13.359905-06:00","updat

  **Code Extraction** (via tree-sitter):\n   - **Symbols**: High-level overview (packages, imports, type/function names with line numbers)\n   - **Definitions**: Full type definitions, interfaces, and function signatures\n   - **Data**: Constants and initialized variables\n\n   **Documentation Extraction**:\n   - **Semantic chunking**: Splits docs by headers/sections when token limits allow\n   -

github.com/mvp-joe/project-cortex/cmd/cortex@v1.3.1\n```\n\nThis installs the `cortex` CLI which includes:\n- Code and documentation indexer\n- MCP server for AI assistants\n\n**Option 2: Download pre-built binary**\n\nDownload the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mvp-joe/project-cortex/releases):\n- **cortex** - Main CLI for indexing and MCP server\n\n### Index Your Project\n\nNavigate to your project directory and run:\n\n```bash\n# One-time indexing\ncortex index\n\n# Watch mode for active development\ncortex index --watch\n```\n\nThis creates a `.cortex/` directory with:\n\n```\n.cortex/\n  config.yml                 # Configuration\n  chunks/\n    code-symbols.json        # High-level code map\n    code-definitions.json    # Type/function signatures\n    code-data.json           # Constants and values\n    doc-chunks.json          # Documentation (README, guides, etc.)\n```\n\nThe `doc-chunks.json` file contains chunked documentation (split by headers/sections within token limits), enabling your AI assistant to understand architectural decisions, design patterns, and the reasoning behind implementation

README.md (section 6)","text":"## About Embeddings\n\nProject Cortex uses **vector embeddings** to enable semantic search- finding code and documentation by meaning, not just keywords. By default, Cortex uses **cortex-embed**, a standalone embedding server that:\n\n- Runs as a shared service across all your projects\n- Loads an ML model once into memory (instead of per project)\n- Provides local, privacy-first embeddings (your code never leaves your machine)\n- Automatically downloads and starts when needed- no manual setup\n\n**Note on Binary Size**: The `cortex-embed` binary is ~300MB because it bundles a complete Python 3.11 runtime and ML libraries (sentence-transformers, PyTorch). This design choice prioritizes zero-dependency installation over file size—users don't need to manage Python environments, pip dependencies, or model downloads. The binary is downloaded once to `~/.cortex/bin/` and shared across all projects.\n\nSee [cortex-embed documentation](docs/cortex-embed.md) for technical details.\n\n**Future support**: We plan to support remote embedding providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) for users who prefer remote embedding

README.md (section 10)","text":"## Use Cases\n\n- **Large codebases**: Maintain architectural context across thousands of files- understand system design, not just individual functions\n- **Onboarding for humans and AI**: New engineers grasp design philosophy, best practices, and the \"why\" behind technical decisions\n- **Legacy systems**: Discover architectural decisions and constraints that aren't obvious from code alone\n- **Complex domains**: Projects where understanding requires both code and extensive domain knowledge documentation\n- **Well-documented projects**: Teams that invest

Modifying the embedding server implementation\n\n### 1. Prepare the Release\n\n1. **Test locally**\n   ```bash\n   # Generate Python deps for your platform (if needed)\n   task python:deps:darwin-arm64  # or your platform\n\n# Build cortex-embed\n   task build:embed\n\n# Test it works\n   ./bin/cortex-embed\n   ```\n\n2. **Test the release process (optional)**\n   ```bash\n   # Generate all platform deps (slow, 10-20 min)\n   task python:deps:all\n\n# Test snapshot release locally\n   goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --config .goreleaser.embed.yml\n   ls -lh dist/\n   ```\n\n### 2. Create and Push the Tag\n\n1. **Create the tag with `-embed` suffix**\n   ```bash\n   # Example for embed version 1.1.0\n   git tag -a v1.1.0-embed -m \"Release cortex-embed v1.1.0\n\n- Update to sentence-transformers 3.0\n   - Add support for new embedding model\n   \"\n   ```\n\n2. **Push the tag**\n   ```bash\n   git push origin v1.1.0-embed\n   ```\n\n### 3.

RELEASING.md (section 7)","text":"## Troubleshooting\n\n### Wrong workflow triggered\n\n**Problem**: Tagged `v1.5.0` but cortex-embed workflow ran (or vice versa)\n\n**Solution**:\n- Cortex CLI releases must use `v*` tags (e.g., `v1.5.0`)\n- Cortex-embed releases must use `v*-embed` suffix (e.g., `v1.1.0-embed`)\n- Delete the incorrect tag and re-tag with the correct pattern\n\n### GitHub Actions fails to generate Python dependencies (cortex-embed)\n\n**Problem**: Python dependency generation times out or fails\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for errors\n2. Test locally: `task python:deps:all`\n3. Ensure `requirements.txt` is valid\n4. Check for network issues with PyPI\n5. Cache may be corrupted - clear it in GitHub Actions settings\n\n### GoReleaser build fails\n\n**Problem**: GoReleaser can't build one of the binaries\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check the error message in GitHub Actions logs\n2. Test locally:\n   - Cortex: `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --config .goreleaser.yml`\n   - Cortex-embed: `goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --config .goreleaser.embed.yml`\n3. Verify configuration: `goreleaser check --config .goreleaser.yml`\n4. For cortex-embed: Ensure Python dependencies exist for all platforms\n\n### Release missing artifacts\n\n**Problem**: Some binaries or archives are missing from the release\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check if the build succeeded for all platforms in GitHub Actions logs\n2. Review the GoReleaser output logs\n3.

RELEASING.md (section 10)","text":"## Important Notes\n\n### Release Independence\n- Cortex and cortex-embed have **independent version numbers**\n- Cortex `v1.5.0` may work with cortex-embed `v1.0.0`\n- Update cortex-embed only when embedding infrastructure changes\n- Most releases will be cortex-only (`v*` tags)\n\n### Performance\n- **Cortex releases**: ~5 minutes (fast, no Python deps)\n- **Cortex-embed releases**: ~6-10 minutes total\n  - First run or `requirements.txt` change: ~6 min (parallel generation)\n  - Subsequent runs: ~1 min (cache hits) + ~5 min (build)\n\n### Tag Discipline\n- **ALWAYS** use correct tag pattern:\n  - Cortex: `v1.5.0`, `v2.0.0-beta`, etc.\n  - Cortex-embed: `v1.0.0-embed`, `v1.1.0-embed`, etc.\n- Wrong pattern triggers wrong workflow\n- Embed

citizens, enabling unified semantic search across implementation details and usage instructions.","embedding":[-0.050981484,0.014022356,-0.015507746,-0.004785655,-0.0073716305,-0.011289832,-0.01555139,-0.027836006,-0.021758134,0.03136198,0.03227962,-0.0045918077,0.024961809,0.05811826,0.03894543,0.015397129,-0.03346557,0.06628907,0.06127266,-0.0011264334,0.038565937,-0.042548474,0.0025488245,0.031196572,-0.066950925,0.078477874,-0.020696936,-0.05385913,-0.033256933,-0.18310274,-0.021123568,0.022211876,0.12163553,0.0043784105,0.016271176,-0.0014355463,0.012260705,0.058527622,0.04684902,0.03781236,-0.0068176296,-0.024206636,0.042751078,-0.00020831446,0.022556787,-0.023821326,0.031795796,-0.014153737,-0.023374122,-0.0058196527,-0.005756852,-0.017586822,0.00035566653,0.01968675,-0.036622003,0.04792503,0.020948652,0.088840574,0.032602813,0.020332888,0.03737538,0.003236466,-0.08954015,0.07174856,0.032912742,0.06929061,-0.050836753,-0.07152458,0.004586536,0.08369541,0.0028041147,0.050346673,0.042412497,0.028115882,0.053306993,0.024465635,0.0069793467,-0.0102745695,0.039340418,-0.0625774,-0.081016034,0.01045922,-0.025502501,0.0034749282,-0.04300903,0.021586867,-0.06983994,0.026385063,-0.019224543,-0.036646444,-0.024731934,-0.0065730126,-0.060595762,0.009726996,-0.040616885,0.010091912,-0.019542497,-0.009833916,-0.009425562,0.35909384,0.00008544937,-0.039645903,0.02994421,-0.060892157,-0.023866775,-0.059532702,0.039264478,-0.040519554,-0.017005352,0.003906409,-0.044353615,0.009245254,-0.012931088,-0.03311277,0.053322718,-0.01965502,0.039484352,-0.0007600677,0.0060688513,-0.01785963,0.021231554,0.0031762712,-0.009143925,-0.011917792,-0.02422891,-0.010725638,0.029128827,0.077686936,0.0008984048,-0.007245277,0.035780326,0.07688824,-0.060562406,0.039969686,0.007572254,0.028278433,-0.018750306,0.0032091956,-0.04300528,-0.01726919,-0.023665573,0.07295054,0.03546431,-0.01649204,-0.09799684,0.09354077,-0.0067195664,-0.004063244,-0.04463251,-0.021787409,0.0165701,0.060565665,0.014103729,-0.037581228,-0.029855598,0.009389948,0.042515438,-0.010094323,-0.049150225,-0.06409903,0.0044157286,-0.05067933,-0.04255873,0.13288453,-0.015126855,-0.10775349,0.039896324,0.010300112,-0.023905044,-0.012348023,0.0058783423,0.0141643565,0.007831675,-0.0011157715,-0.014041326,0.004281616,-0.07607745,0.05893111,0.0041621816,0.040795505,-0.013677847,-0.06718402,0.046227492,-0.0037666026,-0.0065577175,-0.046560716,0.03156666,-0.035104018,-0.052986722,-0.043247294,-0.03638559,0.076695345,0.011148594,0.028442759,0.015059532,-0.007930502,0.021361846,-0.0009440639,-0.06778735,0.027340658,-0.0137240905,0.05351956,-0.028686658,0.053569846,0.026022295,-0.033136185,-0.008436536,0.025926782,-0.0027042562,0.016436156,-0.042538036,0.02485821,-0.001264969,-0.015823407,-0.016917028,-0.050893303,0.010315292,0.033327293,-0.049571905,0.08326855,-0.030888053,-0.030044675,0.0101846345,-0.2925036,0.0062670344,-0.013434945,-0.02091627,-0.03476227,-0.086440794,-0.029834798,-0.018818706,-0.032370415,0.037533395,0.09952312,-0.03762196,-0.01626656,0.017064488,-0.030629897,-0.002783905,0.091867425,0.0028998943,-0.037032295,-0.0074430453,0.06236601,0.030253544,0.04719605,-0.107487716,-0.0034769312,0.028706761,0.12066292,-0.03583908,0.07459798,0.003618376,-0.028450213,0.031272884,0.0036926128,-0.1247633,0.043588698,-0.0059265234,0.00914049,0.0018248687,-0.019707931,-0.052348517,-0.051069304,-0.011087495,0.010425628,-0.041696362,-0.039962694,-0.013282608,-0.033211287,-0.058354303,-0.02004248,0.014931076,-0.049763996,0.008462483,-0.06664004,0.012681221,-0.06291333,-0.0069910795,-0.045430545,0.008197041,-0.04066302,0.035360564,0.017573247,-0.0062197177,-0.046636127,-0.049846414,0.067148685,0.004947015,0.015739353,0.023986328,0.058764543,-0.030789329,-0.013189274,0.10639714,-0.0058251717,-0.034415018,0.055526663,0.014443667,0.026290083,-0.030509142,0.0357991,-0.024709158,0.062483158,-0.0010676289,0.016225042,-0.083445966,0.058226205,0.0005259564,0.049101852,-0.042698722,0.0430088,0.04507699,0.038746502,0.047479782,-0.061958533,-0.05293701,0.07860847,-0.012021642,-0.25630167,0.028957138,0.053317837,0.047214784,-0.011178056,0.021817947,0.008242658,-0.09808822,-0.017932978,-0.040725753,-0.0005445247,0.06006417,0.018703459,0.0062945257,-0.0056758104,0.0020774158,0.12121694,-0.036994938,0.0511065,-0.023139607,0.008987771,0.06544582,0.16396222,-0.015322816,0.03195576,-0.045914795,0.0076251314,-0.049540825,-0.028601673,0.025757862,0.032169864,-0.0407509,0.044981275,0.040066406,0.010307325,0.07500742,0.019977113,-0.0022840898,0.036186613,0.016826954,0.044293426,0.021732872,-0.040020242,-0.0066108345,0.030344607,0.062622406,-0.048779782,-0.02034464,-0.0704275,-0.028740395,-0.042524766,-0.05444383,-0.03400198,-0.022580082,0.02131096,0.038491912,-0.033315916,-0.035854857,-0.018191477,-0.016383132,0.05731357,-0.036982667,0.054774594,0.050625272,-0.021691246],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":0,"end_line":10,"file_path":"docs/architecture.md","section_index":1,"source":"markdown","start_line":5,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"crea

incremental parser that builds concrete syntax trees for source code. Tree-sitter provides:\n\n- **Language-agnostic parsing**: Consistent API across all supported languages\n- **Error recovery**: Can parse incomplete or invalid code\n- **Incremental updates**: Only re-parses changed sections\n- **Syntax node queries**: SQL-like query language for extracting patterns\n\n### Three-Tier Extraction\n\nFor each source file, Project Cortex extracts code at three levels of detail. The extraction happens in two phases:\n\n**Phase 1: Tree-sitter Extraction (Internal)**\n\nTree-sitter parses the code into a syntax tree and extracts structured data:\n\n```json\n// Internal extraction (not stored in chunks)\n{\n  \"file\": \"internal/server/handler.go\",\n  \"package\": \"server\",\n  \"imports\": [\"net/http\", \"encoding/json\"],\n  \"types\": [\n    {\"name\": \"Handler\", \"kind\": \"struct\", \"line\": 15},\n    {\"name\": \"Config\", \"kind\": \"struct\", \"line\": 22}\n  ],\n  \"functions\": [\n    {\"name\": \"NewHandler\", \"line\": 30},\n    {\"name\": \"ServeHTTP\", \"receiver\": \"Handler\", \"line\": 45}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Phase 2: Chunk Formatting (What Gets Embedded)**\n\nThe structured data is formatted as natural language text optimized for vector embeddings:\n\n#### 1. Symbols (High-Level Overview)\n\n**Purpose**: Quick navigation and understanding of file structure.\n\n**Formatted Output** (what goes in chunk text field):","embedding":[-0.06389012,0.009010522,-0.03657827,-0.077622436,0.033951957,-0.035334464,-0.02721976,-0.04708148,0.006597274,-0.01692484,0.059790533,-0.06675296,0.04073733,-0.026537554,0.01229732,-0.0014400309,0.013212599,0.03820289,0.039591625,-0.0383118,0.008936631,-0.050331917,0.0005503428,-0.047296178,-0.007767938,0.09473531,-0.06234938,-0.068645954,-0.027697816,-0.23971221,-0.0035971473,-0.053441003,0.045022488,0.003110312,-0.02458107,0.044142593,0.0017686563,0.037469506,0.0017309623,0.057113167,0.02153338,-0.031748228,-0.052594338,0.021134142,-0.009057732,-0.029557094,-0.009383849,-0.009475322,0.0018033775,0.03926733,-0.10710178,-0.028547248,0.023233978,0.029202966,-0.010625192,0.025488267,0.013063458,0.064543165,-0.010237674,0.050702814,0.0060790465,-0.012884699,-0.10688314,0.06597738,0.07106376,0.040282696,-0.022267707,-0.027711518,0.011281896,0.080153584,-0.005039096,0.037676647,-0.0039617205,0.03512809,0.0066457004,-0.028702019,0.035144396,0.028529504,0.06308919,-0.007813443,-0.04036254,0.0493097,-0.032166418,0.02067152,-0.030515209,0.04482677,-0.059981205,0.03554472,0.026532307,0.020240072,-0.03180078,-0.038939815,-0.0036063192,0.040263887,-0.07245336,0.0014699695,0.027030738,0.0120469015,0.029478315,0.34209287,-0.048838586,0.0054304036,-0.01887378,-0.05637529,-0.0076050567,-0.042220306,0.008366557,-0.068049625,0.029172203,-0.020239878,-0.03309839,-0.014980524,0.004453611,-0.042811777,0.059492186,-0.031940483,0.052865654,0.0029271878,-0.064335026,0.016142711,0.0044244635,0.043987855,-0.009168063,0.0032194657,0.03153963,0.017294325,0.009579449,0.05611036,0.1054056,0.06428561,0.035451625,0.0245853,-0.058852274,0.021333978,-0.0060768384,0.010706595,0.001700536,0.00664828,-0.015962211,-0.046188843,-0.011017453,0.002770782,0.00802852,-0.00094926637,-0.08858042,0.115443304,-0.009578526,-0.039281826,-0.040568817,-0.05318585,-0.07484114,0.05293696,0.010032617,-0.051718373,0.010453563,0.024924934,0.009351468,-0.04905752,-0.015601312,-0.050533343,-0.021925297,-0.059165444,0.00097373663,0.10521486,0.03246036,-0.08842514,-0.017266639,0.022371259,0.007937634,-0.023445046,0.026799498,0.03263673,0.008719778,-0.02570018,-0.042875376,0.0043775328,-0.046802916,-0.010334396,0.028601483,0.008314177,0.0062149707,-0.008154313,0.0075092074,0.067927904,0.011595169,-0.08395919,-0.047119442,0.02590842,-0.015656127,-0.020244444,-0.03672605,0.005537822,-0.017887779,-0.016854016,0.0019504306,-0.0052697966,0.01681349,-0.0041152737,-0.007965289,-0.04077415,0.088986926,0.04680773,-0.011797941,0.048473768,-0.024475843,-0.040551037,0.024111873,0.004507787,0.0115819555,0.008671129,-0.049651485,0.017669342,0.036376383,0.009434769,-0.03119482,0.011883584,0.054203957,-0.0018773866,-0.00561045,0.09785273,-0.07143219,-0.054872062,-0.005799883,-0.34172842,-0.019973576,0.038239274,-0.026597375,-0.020851575,-0.084687375,-0.026003722,-0.020105168,-0.0048691486,0.0016430332,0.06095388,-0.0091225915,-0.005802359,-0.024348583,-0.010847691,0.009997193,0.07242574,-0.021749739,-0.032795697,0.00005547257,0.046139706,0.016444959,0.017227717,-0.019222353,0.0082335295,0.002075396,0.12881868,0.039318573,0.050889682,-0.013736057,0.053422768,0.035440497,0.013427315,-0.06893867,-0.013976361,-0.0118168695,0.0067437137,0.018955989,0.001821465,0.017258732,0.039283365,-0.0065180594,0.0035475625,-0.08621769,-0.010813274,0.002962245,-0.048591785,-0.053729594,0.0172469,-0.004900506,0.00047830952,0.003633246,0.035396993,0.035200402,-0.0241179,-0.007119137,-0.02256154,0.01673212,-0.031667866,0.013043504,0.021076273,-0.030676758,-0.035108864,-0.027283536,0.033156946,0.021615975,0.026810965,0.011809099,0.044268876,-0.013086432,-0.037916273,0.063357554,-0.010854462,-0.036039334,0.044650048,0.06806822,-0.011964786,-0.019306725,-0.02360173,0.01074207,0.05139241,0.034482453,0.05075618,-0.058451075,0.021944143,0.009576099,0.046152864,-0.039509144,0.04960342,-0.016075725,0.03213976,0.017021367,-0.04701606,0.015870923,0.09556158,0.047829527,-0.28672004,0.022697682,0.033020176,-0.0069718217,0.05364495,-0.004597713,0.03081054,-0.06330528,-0.005625779,-0.016230684,-0.013503511,0.07050459,0.0006550961,-0.024795063,-0.0077359746,0.03443846,0.116271086,0.02911724,0.013892793,-0.048161093,0.05316879,-0.00021391248,0.16761036,-0.007221712,0.009747088,-0.0012778452,-0.008613767,-0.041228812,0.0540141,-0.020775795,-0.028803036,-0.016899316,0.10319666,0.047729276,-0.010628314,0.057896446,0.039668933,0.038070627,0.029487282,-0.02748248,0.033233713,0.00802251,-0.042660978,-0.042571574,0.01601887,-0.095596746,0.017404998,-0.078639105,-0.012452783,-0.005733099,-0.021125529,-0.0168652,-0.02742328,-0.027409881,-0.029749293,0.04045289,-0.027772883,-0.0015016455,-0.06112652,0.024410242,0.027038047,-0.051652238,0.0788623,0.052984644,0.0041970345],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":0,"end_line":143,"file_path":"docs/architecture.md","section_index":3,"source":"markdown","start_line":99,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"created_at":"2025-10-28T22:0

docs/architecture.md (section 3)","text":"- **Header-based splitting**: Attempts to split at `#`, `##`, `###` headers when token limits allow\n- **Token limit reality**: Local embedding models (384-512 tokens) often require mid-section splits; cloud models (1024+ tokens) have more flexibility\n- **Context metadata**: Each chunk includes file path, section titles, and header hierarchy\n- **Trade-off aware**: Long sections or large code blocks may be split across chunks—embeddings still capture semantic meaning\n- **No perfect preservation**: We optimize for searchability within constraints, not perfect document structure\n\n**Example Documentation Chunk:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"doc:README.md:authentication:section\",\n  \"type\": \"documentation\",\n  \"file\": \"README.md\",\n  \"headers\": [\"Authentication\", \"Getting Started\"],\n  \"content\": \"# Authentication\\n\\nTo authenticate users, use the `AuthHandler`...\",\n  \"code_blocks\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": \"go\",\n      \"content\": \"auth := NewAuthHandler(config)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"links\": [\"docs/auth-guide.md\", \"examples/auth-example.go\"],\n  \"embedding\": [0.123, -0.456, ...]\n}\n```\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nWhen an AI assistant needs to understand authentication in your system, it gets:\n- **Architectural rationale**: Why this auth approach was chosen (design

docs/architecture.md (section 4)","text":"## Phase 2: Chunking \u0026 Embedding\n\n### Chunk Creation\n\nExtracted code and documentation are broken into chunks optimized for vector search:\n\n**Chunking Strategy:**\n- **Symbols**: One chunk per file (small, for quick lookup)\n- **Definitions**: One chunk per type/function (medium, for understanding)\n- **Data**: Grouped by related constants (small, for configuration)\n- **Docs**: Semantic sections based on headers (medium, for context)\n\nEach chunk includes metadata:\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"go:internal/server/handler.go:Handler:definition\",\n  \"type\": \"code-definition\",\n  \"language\": \"go\",\n  \"file\": \"internal/server/handler.go\",\n  \"start_line\": 15,\n  \"end_line\": 18,\n  \"content\": \"type Handler struct {...}\",\n  \"embedding\": [0.123, -0.456, ...]\n}\n```\n\n### Embedding Generation\n\nChunks are converted to vector embeddings using configurable

code-symbols.json        # Quick file/function lookup\n    code-definitions.json    # Type/interface understanding\n    code-data.json           # Constants and configuration\n    doc-chunks.json          # Documentation search\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- **Human-readable**: Easy to inspect and debug\n- **Git-friendly**: Version controlled alongside code\n- **Incremental updates**: Git handles diffs automatically\n- **Shareable**: Teams can commit indexes for instant context\n\n### Metadata for Incremental Updates\n\nEach chunk file includes metadata enabling smart re-indexing:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"indexed_at\": \"2025-10-15T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"file_hashes\": {\n    \"internal/server/handler.go\": \"a1b2c3d4...\",\n    \"internal/config/config.go\": \"e5f6g7h8...\"\n  },\n  \"chunks\": [...]\n}\n```\n\nWhen running `cortex index`:\n1.

chromem-go** in-memory vector database\n3. **Adds chunks** to vector collections\n4. **Listens via stdio** for MCP protocol requests\n\n```go\n// Simplified flow\nfunc serveMCP() {\n    db := chromem.NewDB()\n\n    // Load chunks from JSON files\n    symbolChunks := loadChunks(\"code-symbols.json\")\n    defChunks := loadChunks(\"code-definitions.json\")\n    dataChunks :=

Common pattern: \"Why was X built this way?\" → design docs + code\n\n3. **Unified Search (Recommended)**:\n   - Search code + docs simultaneously\n   - Combine results for complete understanding\n   - Example: \"authentication\" returns AuthHandler code AND design rationale from docs\n\n4. **Context-Driven Search**:\n   - Surface architectural context for unfamiliar code\n   - Find design

\"local\"\n  model: \"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\"\n  dimensions: 384  # Vector size for BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\n  endpoint: \"http://localhost:8121/embed\"\n```\n\n**Note**: The `cortex-embed` server starts automatically when you run `cortex index` or `cortex mcp`.

docs/contributing.md (section 5)","text":"## Adding Language Support\n\nAdding support for a new language involves three steps:\n\n### 1. Add Tree-sitter Grammar\n\nInstall the tree-sitter grammar as a Go dependency:\n\n```bash\ngo get github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-\u003clanguage\u003e\n```\n\n### 2. Create Parser Implementation\n\nCreate `internal/parser/\u003clanguage\u003e.go`:\n\n```go\npackage parser\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/smacker/go-tree-sitter\"\n    tree_sitter_\u003clanguage\u003e \"github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-\u003clanguage\u003e\"\n)\n\ntype LanguageParser struct {\n    language *tree_sitter.Language\n}\n\nfunc NewLanguageParser() *LanguageParser {\n    return \u0026LanguageParser{\n        language: tree_sitter.\u003clanguage\u003e.GetLanguage(),\n    }\n}\n\nfunc (p *LanguageParser) Parse(content []byte) (*tree_sitter.Tree, error) {\n    parser := tree_sitter.NewParser()\n    parser.SetLanguage(p.language)\n    return parser.Parse(content), nil\n}\n\nfunc (p *LanguageParser) ExtractSymbols(tree *tree_sitter.Tree, content []byte) (map[string]interface{}, error) {\n    // Implement symbol extraction using tree-sitter queries\n    // See internal/parser/go.go for reference\n}\n\nfunc (p *LanguageParser) ExtractDefinitions(tree *tree_sitter.Tree, content []byte) ([]Definition, error) {\n    // Implement definition extraction\n}\n\nfunc (p *LanguageParser) ExtractData(tree *tree_sitter.Tree, content []byte) ([]DataItem, error) {\n    // Implement data extraction\n}\n```\n\n### 3.

Register the Parser\n\nAdd to `internal/parser/registry.go`:\n\n```go\nfunc init() {\n    Register(\"language\", NewLanguageParser())\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Add Tests\n\nCreate `internal/parser/\u003clanguage\u003e_test.go`:\n\n```go\npackage parser\n\nimport (\n    \"testing\"\n    \"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert\"\n)\n\nfunc TestLanguageParser_ExtractSymbols(t *testing.T) {\n    parser := NewLanguageParser()\n    content := []byte(`\n        // Sample language code\n    `)\n\n    tree, err := parser.Parse(content)\n    assert.NoError(t, err)\n\n    symbols, err := parser.ExtractSymbols(tree, content)\n    assert.NoError(t, err)\n    assert.NotNil(t, symbols)\n\n    // Assert expected symbols\n    assert.Equal(t, \"expected_package\", symbols[\"package\"])\n}\n```\n\n### 6.

docs/contributing.md (section 6)","text":"## Code Style\n\n### Go Style\n\nFollow standard Go conventions:\n\n- Use `gofmt` for formatting\n- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)\n- Use meaningful variable names\n- Write godoc comments for exported functions\n\n```go\n// Good\nfunc ExtractSymbols(tree *sitter.Tree, content []byte) (map[string]interface{}, error) {\n    // Implementation\n}\n\n// Bad\nfunc es(t *sitter.Tree, c []byte) (map[string]interface{}, error) {\n    // Implementation\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nAlways handle errors explicitly:\n\n```go\n// Good\ntree, err := parser.Parse(content)\nif err != nil {\n    return nil, fmt.Errorf(\"failed to parse: %w\", err)\n}\n\n// Bad\ntree, _ := parser.Parse(content)\n```\n\n### Logging\n\nUse structured logging:\n\n```go\nimport \"log/slog\"\n\nslog.Info(\"indexing file\", \"path\", filePath, \"language\", lang)\nslog.Error(\"failed to parse\", \"error\", err, \"file\", filePath)\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nWrite table-driven tests:\n\n```go\nfunc TestExtractSymbols(t *testing.T) {\n    tests := []struct {\n        name     string\n        input    string\n        expected map[string]interface{}\n    }{\n        {\n            name:  \"simple function\",\n            input: \"func main() {}\",\n            expected:

You'll typically have one or more `cortex` instances per project (possibly multiple per Claude Code session).\n\n`cortex-embed` is a **shared service** that any number of `cortex` processes can call. This architecture means:\n- The embedding model (~130MB) is loaded into memory only once\n- Multiple projects can share the same embedding server\n- Both `cortex` CLI and `cortex-indexer` use the same

docs/cortex-embed.md (section 3)","text":"## How does it work?\n\n### Embedded Python Runtime\n\n`cortex-embed` uses [go-embed-python](https://github.com/kluctl/go-embed-python) to bundle:\n- Complete Python 3.11 runtime\n- sentence-transformers library\n- PyTorch (CPU-only)\n- FastAPI web server\n- All Python dependencies\n\nThe entire ML stack is embedded in a single Go binary with zero external dependencies.\n\n### Startup Flow\n\n1. `cortex` starts and needs embeddings\n2. Checks if `cortex-embed` is running (health check on `http://127.0.0.1:8121`)\n3. If not running, downloads appropriate binary for the platform (if needed) and starts it\n4. `cortex-embed` extracts Python environment to temp directory\n5. Launches FastAPI server and loads BGE-small-en-v1.5 model\n6. First run: Downloads ~130MB model from HuggingFace (cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/`)\n7. Subsequent runs: Loads cached model in 5-10 seconds\n8. `cortex` makes HTTP POST requests to `/embed` endpoint\n\n### API\n\nSimple HTTP API on port 8121:\n\n**POST /embed**\n```json\n{\n  \"texts\":

docs/cortex-embed.md (section 5)","text":"## Architecture Decisions\n\n### Why Python for embeddings?\n\n- Mature ML ecosystem (HuggingFace, transformers, PyTorch)\n- Access to thousands of pre-trained models\n- Better inference performance than pure Go ML libraries\n- Trade binary size (~300MB) for functionality and ecosystem access\n\n### Why separate binary?\n\n- `cortex` remains lightweight and fast to install via `go install`\n- Users who only use non-embedding features don't download 300MB\n- Embedding server can be shared across multiple projects\n- Can version and release independently\n- Easier to swap out embedding providers in the future\n\n### Why not a remote API?\n\nWe will support remote embedding APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) in the future, but local embeddings offer:\n- Zero cost for local development\n- No API keys needed\n- Works offline\n- Privacy - code never leaves the machine\n- Lower latency for large

docs/cortex-embed.md (section 9)","text":"## Implementation Notes\n\n### PyTorch Compatibility\n\nEmbedded Python environments exclude test modules. PyTorch's `torch._dynamo.trace_rules` unconditionally imports `torch._inductor.test_operators`, which doesn't exist in our embedded environment.\n\nWe monkey-patch a dummy module before any torch imports:\n```python\nimport sys, types\nsys.modules['torch._inductor.test_operators'] = types.ModuleType('torch._inductor.test_operators')\n```\n\nThis only affects imports - inference functionality is unaffected.\n\n### Model Caching UX\n\nTo avoid confusing users with repeated download messages:\n- Check if model exists in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--BAAI--bge-small-en-v1.5/`\n- First

docs/cortex-embed.md (section 10)","text":"## Future Enhancements\n\n### Remote Embedding Providers\n- **OpenAI API**: Use `text-embedding-3-small` or `text-embedding-3-large` via API key\n- **Anthropic API**: Support for Anthropic's embedding models when available\n- **Other providers**: Cohere, Voyage AI, or any OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoint\n- **Benefits**: No local binary needed, potentially better quality, pay-as-you-go pricing\n\n### Direct Python Execution\nInstead of embedding Python in a Go binary, detect if the user's machine already has the necessary dependencies:\n- **Detect Python environment**: Check for Python 3.9+ with required packages\n- **Version validation**: Ensure PyTorch, sentence-transformers, FastAPI are correct versions\n- **Direct execution**: Run `embedding_service.py` directly without `cortex-embed` download\n- **Benefits**: Faster startup (no extraction), easier development, smaller download\n- **Fallback**: If deps missing or wrong versions, fall back to `cortex-embed` binary\n\n### Model Options\n- Additional embedding models (larger/smaller trade-offs)\n- Model quantization to reduce

docs/mcp-integration.md (section 4)","text":"## Integration with Claude Code\n\nClaude Code has native MCP support. Here's how to connect Project Cortex:\n\n### 1. Index Your Project\n\nNavigate to your project directory:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/project\ncortex index\n```\n\nThis creates `.cortex/chunks/` with your indexed code.\n\n### 2. Configure Claude Code\n\nEdit Claude Code's MCP configuration file:\n\n**Location**: `~/.claude/mcp.json`\n\nAdd Project Cortex server:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"project-cortex\": {\n      \"command\": \"cortex\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"],\n      \"cwd\": \"/path/to/your/project\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: Set `cwd` to your project directory (where `.cortex/` exists).\n\n### 3. Restart Claude Code\n\nRestart Claude Code to load the new MCP server configuration.\n\n### 4. Test the Connection\n\nAsk Claude Code questions about your codebase and documentation. Claude Code will automatically invoke `cortex_search` with appropriate filters:\n\n**Architectural Understanding:**\n\n```\nYou: \"Why is authentication implemented this way?\"\n```\n\nClaude Code uses: `cortex_search` with `chunk_types: [\"documentation\", \"definitions\"]` to query both design docs (ADRs, architecture guides) and code implementation.\n\n**Design Context:**\n\n```\nYou: \"What are the best practices for error handling in this project?\"\n```\n\nClaude Code uses: `cortex_search` with `tags: [\"documentation\"]` to find contribution guides, design docs, and documented

docs/mcp-integration.md (section 6)","text":"## Per-Project Configuration\n\nInstead of global configuration, you can configure MCP per-project using a local config file.\n\n### Create `.mcp.json` in Your Project Root\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"cortex\": {\n      \"command\": \"cortex\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important**: The file must be named `.mcp.json` (not `.claude/mcp.json`) and placed in your project root directory.\n\nNo `cwd` needed - it defaults to the project directory.\n\n### Advantages\n\n- Team can share configuration via Git\n- Different projects can have different MCP setups\n- No global configuration

Unified Search (All Types)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"how does authentication work\",\n  \"limit\": 20\n}\n```\n\n**Returns**: Mixed results—design rationale from docs, code symbols, definitions, and configs. Complete picture of authentication in your project.\n\n#### 5. Language-Specific Search\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"error handling patterns\",\n  \"tags\": [\"typescript\", \"code\"]\n}\n```\n\n**Returns**: Only TypeScript code related to error handling.\n\n#### 6. Domain-Specific Search\n\n```json\n{\n  \"query\": \"user management best practices\",\n  \"tags\": [\"users\", \"auth\"]\n}\n```\n\n**Returns**: Content tagged with user/auth topics across code and

`chunk_types` and `tags`\n- Get structured results with full metadata (file paths, line numbers, etc.)\n- AI assistants can decide what filters to use based on your

installed**:\n   ```bash\n   which cortex\n   # Should show path to binary\n   ```\n\n2. **Check index exists**:\n   ```bash\n   ls .cortex/chunks/\n   # Should show *.json files\n   ```\n\n3. **Test MCP server manually**:\n   ```bash\n   cortex mcp --log-level debug\n   ```\n   Should start without errors.\n\n4. **Check MCP config path**:\n   Ensure `cwd` points to correct project directory.\n\n### No Search Results\n\n**Symptoms**: AI assistant queries return empty results.\n\n**Solutions**:\n\n1. **Re-index project**:\n   ```bash\n   cortex index --force\n   ```\n\n2. **Check chunks were created**:\n   ```bash\n   cat .cortex/chunks/code-symbols.json | head\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify embeddings**:\n   Check `.cortex/config.yml` embedding configuration.\n\n4. **Lower similarity threshold**:\n   ```yaml\n   vector_db:\n     min_score: 0.2  # Lower threshold\n   ```\n\n### High Memory Usage\n\n**Symptoms**: MCP server uses too much RAM.\n\n**Solutions**:\n\n1. **Reduce chunk count**:\n   ```yaml\n   indexing:\n     include_tests: false\n     max_file_size: \"200KB\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Use compression**:\n   ```yaml\n   output:\n     compress: true\n   ```\n\n3. **Limit collections**:\n   Only load needed chunk files in MCP server.\n\n### Slow Queries\n\n**Symptoms**: AI assistant takes long to get results.\n\n**Solutions**:\n\n1. **Check index size**:\n   ```bash\n

Search type | Keyword | Semantic |\n| Understands code structure | No | Yes |\n| Context aware | No | Yes |\n| **Documentation search** | **Basic text match** | **Semantic meaning** |\n| Requires exact keywords | Yes | No |\n| **Example discovery** | **Manual grep** | **Automatic** |\n\n**Real-World Documentation Example:**\n\nYou want to understand why a specific authentication approach was chosen:\n\n**grep approach:**\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"authentication\" docs/\n# Returns 200+ matches across many files\n# Manually read through to find design rationale\n# May miss relevant ADRs that use different terminology\n```\n\n**Project Cortex approach:**\n\n```\nQuery: \"authentication design decisions\"\n# Returns (ranked by semantic relevance):\n# 1. docs/adrs/003-oauth-vs-jwt.md (design decision)\n# 2. docs/architecture.md (section: Authentication Strategy)\n# 3. docs/security-requirements.md (constraints)\n```\n\n**Key Difference**: Semantic search surfaces *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was implemented. It understands that \"design rationale\" relates to ADRs, trade-offs, and architectural constraints—even when those exact words aren't used.\n\n### Project Cortex vs. LSP\n\n| Feature | LSP | Project

docs/testing-best-practices.md (section 1)","text":"## ✅ Recommended Testing Workflow\n\nWe use a consistent test-driven development (TDD) loop when building or modifying any component.\n\n### 1. Write a test plan as comments\n\nAt the top of each test file, describe what the component must do — like a checklist:\n\n```go\n// Test Plan for TreeSitterParser:\n// - Can parse valid Go source code\n// - Extracts function definitions with correct line numbers\n// - Handles incomplete/invalid code gracefully\n// - Works for all supported languages\n// - Preserves comment blocks\n// - Handles context cancellation\n// - Cleanup releases tree-sitter resources\n```\n\nThis helps think through important test scenarios up front.\n\n### 2. Plan test cases\nLooking at the test plan comments, think deeply about what test cases will prove correctness of the behavior, including edge cases.  While you want correctness you also want to have each test case be meaningful - the goal is proving correctness with reasonable number of tests cases. Use a single-line comment to describe each test case.\n\n``` go\n// Test: Initializing with min workers greater than max workers should return an error\n```\n\n### 3. Think of a general solution\nPlease write a high quality, general purpose solution. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem

docs/testing-best-practices.md (section 1)","text":"Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.\n\nIf the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please tell me. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.\n\n### 4. Review \u0026 iterate on test cases\nReview the code that has been written and the test cases (written or in comments) to identify any missing test cases.  Add any missing test cases as comments to the test file.\n\n### 5. Implement test cases\nReferring to the test comments in the test-file, implement each test-case one-by-one, ensuring that each one passes before moving on to the next test case.\nSome tips:\n* Add tests for failure modes (timeouts, invalid inputs, etc.)\n* Add concurrency tests (t.Parallel(), race detectors)\n* Add shutdown and cleanup behavior\n* This keeps complexity low and confidence high.\n\n### 6. Review code and test\nAfter tests are complete, make one final pass on the code, refactoring if necessary with this focus:\n* Correctness - is the code doing what it should do, not just passing the tests\n* Good Design - the code solves things high-quality, general purpose way - not just a way that passes the tests\n* Readabiilty \u0026 Meaning - if another human or agent reads this code will be immediately clear to them how it works and what it does\n* Consistency - does this code follow existing code styles and naming conventions in this

docs/testing-best-practices.md (section 3)","text":"## Running Tests in Parallel\n\nMost of our tests can run concurrently by adding `t.Parallel()` at the beginning of each test function. This dramatically reduces test execution time.\n\n### Example Transformation\n\n```go\nfunc TestIndexer_ParseGoFile(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel() // Add this line\n\n    // Test: Parse valid Go file returns chunks\n    parser := NewParser(testConfig)\n    chunks, err := parser.Parse(ctx, \"testdata/code/go/simple.go\")\n    // ... rest of test\n}\n```\n\n### Guidelines for Parallel Tests\n\n1. **Safe for parallel execution:**\n   - Tests that only read files\n   - Tests that use t.TempDir() (automatically isolated)\n   - Tests using in-memory operations\n   - Tests with isolated resources\n\n2. **Need careful review:**\n   - Tests that modify global state\n   - Tests with shared file writes\n   - Tests using fixed ports\n\n3. **Cannot be parallel:**\n   - Tests that change

confidence**.\n\n---","embedding":[-0.07051219,0.051171545,-0.008828009,0.026091423,-0.03177233,0.069451064,0.034201715,0.00047399863,-0.057594195,-0.045910522,0.04144348,-0.014701372,0.0022932037,0.045439642,-0.02376402,0.028266428,-0.011804781,-0.029387183,0.07375506,0.039011974,0.014815638,-0.015284825,-0.021513162,0.025896294,-0.033677645,0.038420364,0.01773982,-0.100760505,-0.057133824,-0.1941581,-0.015758347,0.040129058,0.035096828,-0.06538431,-0.017153466,-0.0037494546,-0.005165287,0.021749219,0.0024122824,0.060630396,0.01978914,0.032905437,0.04172045,0.009358217,0.020472962,0.024126075,0.023239862,-0.04222945,-0.009221965,-0.0247747,-0.04186984,-0.056156687,-0.0192457,-0.021302616,-0.07619268,0.030172443,0.013456309,0.044630244,0.07131222,0.021426316,0.008662643,-0.013367666,-0.104822144,0.06904066,0.059977505,0.09746831,-0.03351742,-0.0028367809,-0.03685945,0.08881614,0.018499132,0.053058773,0.013603159,0.07447128,0.05601172,0.00716348,0.0176971,-0.035845645,0.022164337,-0.029002763,-0.053509474,0.002258938,0.01635627,-0.0017809133,0.004330223,-0.000089446985,-0.043675438,0.06957841,0.01966121,0.0022848696,0.013805545,0.0029661788,-0.05931271,0.027531119,-0.050285116,-0.017484315,-0.0386315,-0.023751162,-0.0221015,0.38048208,-0.085457966,0.00031850982,-0.02025875,0.017044934,-0.03908698,-0.03606152,0.024560021,-0.041999493,-0.017122574,0.014279721,-0.031143175,-0.028166758,0.025098484,-0.058175266,0.020812673,-0.032512847,0.012453439,0.047196373,-0.037443865,-0.032910563,0.025589714,0.040624104,0.015877042,-0.043669775,-0.017188976,-0.0056058783,0.023707462,0.091331676,-0.000016599775,0.035060827,-0.0094642285,0.0053323936,-0.04109986,0.035649624,-0.07321017,-0.012096573,-0.00021630437,0.004400531,-0.021991825,0.026796328,0.010353437,0.071395926,0.06546483,-0.039963458,-0.06804634,0.043212913,0.00020328429,0.07202867,-0.07053787,0.011909843,0.043248,0.02537052,0.0022472143,-0.032340877,-0.052372847,-0.057120755,-0.013636805,-0.03082758,-0.016362663,-0.004711501,-0.058958124,0.026839858,-0.060368635,0.1542618,-0.03556154,-0.07115661,-0.003378757,-0.0209046,0.010782146,-0.040355936,-0.018371359,-0.010843509,0.012813068,-0.04472863,-0.024792872,-0.036025766,-0.07541473,0.06380676,0.0006873827,0.03539829,0.06784496,-0.017633075,0.0031926099,0.027312703,0.01698004,-0.03999352,0.0059357123,-0.041589152,0.0019588561,-0.033535864,-0.083787695,-0.0047988826,-0.04207203,0.062216688,-0.02335284,-0.021267863,-0.0017460296,0.018736074,-0.028153196,0.038113687,-0.021876266,0.03125361,-0.009327478,0.081756316,0.011252581,0.0069947857,0.05019185,-0.034599222,0.038540006,0.0771585,-0.07921266,0.021815836,0.017553324,0.012352475,-0.024181327,-0.011639625,-0.02185351,0.0389528,-0.030312946,0.086116865,-0.010969134,-0.045829084,0.0023869814,-0.2903795,-0.0032030242,-0.011505456,0.007880312,0.025503343,0.0011992643,-0.0019567404,0.0008582731,-0.047979735,-0.03756788,0.07434588,-0.042399414,-0.036089145,-0.06444621,-0.043664746,-0.060705952,0.00050919264,-0.086353004,0.004865667,-0.03340593,0.0071451166,0.014475861,0.03543326,-0.08478629,0.04019133,-0.010626666,0.083677694,-0.07097575,0.06686809,0.04138866,0.010829311,0.058315545,0.07105511,-0.10767081,0.06689423,-0.006980011,-0.023306478,0.04103621,-0.05263519,-0.044235315,0.027225524,-0.013831412,0.019214524,-0.09385817,-0.037184935,0.021672515,-0.025199471,0.010320672,-0.005938386,-0.0598538,-0.028207347,0.008870043,-0.025306728,0.032162428,-0.005140674,0.0565613,-0.07775842,-0.037435792,-0.055361636,0.048292857,0.0017789463,0.034454122,-0.03381454,-0.01944551,0.042432584,0.027294174,0.02295415,-0.011674671,0.059756372,0.027381832,0.02013946,0.08134726,-0.01905809,-0.048122074,0.04770815,0.000458588,-0.015244954,-0.017292337,0.039619986,-0.022100369,0.05760394,0.03988884,0.0058065387,-0.020968936,0.038116656,-0.033101425,0.040111855,-0.036516555,0.023124078,0.0039699865,-0.019209791,0.00411711,-0.014560029,-0.07169456,0.03225358,0.00075790676,-0.200807,0.012658352,0.0103004845,0.04887425,-0.01615842,0.013632582,0.0045680543,-0.06085536,-0.03011143,0.040323023,0.043377355,0.08064463,0.05738953,-0.022173427,0.048709363,0.042500384,0.09938503,-0.029005956,0.073891625,-0.04916177,0.004627448,0.0014919612,0.16183782,-0.034541905,-0.01832683,0.042840786,0.044181015,0.023010843,0.029035917,-0.013000408,0.076241806,-0.013147876,-0.03267915,0.022587052,-0.08585835,0.07663337,0.037279386,-0.02182463,0.041482177,-0.013097321,0.024540426,-0.006501355,0.012173683,0.037144404,0.028268384,-0.016918594,-0.055364385,-0.010587947,-0.058334548,-0.021218272,-0.049840398,-0.06528691,-0.006526612,-0.019786313,0.01526017,0.05288339,0.022208733,-0.016509263,-0.041501924,-0.013578915,0.028683523,0.015053864,0.13084917,0.04050754,-0.014714283],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":0,"end_line":8,"file_path":"docs/testing-strategy.md","section_index":0,"source":"markdown","start_line":1,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"created_at":"2025-10-28T22:06:13.362574

Unit Tests (Go)\n\n**Scope:**\nTest individual Go components in isolation.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Use [`testify`](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) for assertions and mocking.\n- Prefer internal interfaces + explicit injection over reflection or monkeypatching.\n- Follow TDD when designing reusable components.\n- Favor clarity and coverage over DRY in test cases.\n\n**Examples:**\n- `parser_test.go` tests tree-sitter parsing for each supported language\n- `chunker_test.go` validates markdown semantic chunking with line tracking\n- `provider_test.go` tests embedding provider interface and factory\n\n---\n\n### 2. Integration Tests (Go)\n\n**Scope:**\nTest how internal components fit together within the CLI tool:\n- Tree-sitter parsing and extraction\n- Embedding provider integration (cortex-embed)\n- Vector database operations (chromem-go)\n- File watching and hot reload\n- MCP protocol integration\n\n**Guidelines:**\n- Use real cortex-embed binary for embedding tests\n- Use chromem-go in-memory for vector search tests\n- Test file system operations with `t.TempDir()`\n- Prefer `black-box` validation: treat components as units and assert observable behavior\n\n**Examples:**\n- Indexer processing a code file end-to-end (parse → chunk → embed → write)\n- MCP server loading chunks and executing searches\n- File watcher detecting changes and triggering reload\n- Incremental indexing with checksum comparison\n\n**File Naming:**\n- `*_integration_test.go` in component directories (e.g., `internal/indexer/`, `internal/mcp/`)\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Loading and deserializing chunks separately for each searcher wastes CPU and creates consistency issues during hot reload.\n\n**Solution**: Single ChunkManager loads chunks once, provides read-only ChunkSet to all searchers, tracks changes for incremental updates.\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐\n│  Chunk Files    │  .cortex/chunks/*.json\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │\n

successfully, text index fails.\n\n**Behavior**:\n- Vector searcher serves new data\n- Text searcher serves old data\n- System logs error\n- Next reload (triggered by file watcher or manual) syncs both\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Eventual consistency acceptable for development tool\n- No rollback complexity\n- Self-healing on next reload\n\n### Context Cancellation\n\n```go\nfunc (cm *ChunkManager)

integration)\n2. **Memory-mapped files**: Use mmap for large chunk files (\u003e100MB)\n3. **Concurrent file loading**: Load 4 chunk files in parallel (4x speedup)\n4. **Chunk compression**: Store

specs/code-graph.md (section 4)","text":"## Why Separate from Semantic Search?\n\n**Semantic search** (cortex_search):\n- **Strengths**: Understands concepts, finds similar patterns, cross-references docs + code\n- **Limitations**: Can't answer \"who calls this function?\" or \"what breaks if I change this interface?\"\n\n**Full-text search** (cortex_exact):\n- **Strengths**: Fast exact matches, finds specific identifiers\n- **Limitations**: No understanding of relationships or dependencies\n\n**Graph queries** (cortex_graph):\n- **Strengths**: Precise structural queries (callers, implementations, dependencies, impact)\n- **Limitations**: No semantic understanding, requires exact identifiers\n\n**Together**: LLM uses all three based on task

directory**:\n- Graph data is fundamentally different from searchable chunks (no embeddings, different query patterns)\n- Clear separation of concerns: `chunks/` = search, `graph/` = relationships\n- Future extensibility: Can add other graph types (e.g., `concept-graph.json`)\n- Cleaner file watching: MCP server can watch directories independently\n\n### code-graph.json

specs/code-graph.md (section 10)","text":"## Context Injection\n\n### Why Not Store Code in Graph?\n\n**Decision**: Store **only** relationships and positions in graph, inject code context via file reads after queries.\n\n**Problems with storing code snippets in graph**:\n1. **Bloat**: Storing code increases graph size unnecessarily when code lives in files.\n2. **Staleness**: If files change between indexing and query, stored snippets are outdated.\n3. **Inflexibility**: Can't adjust context window (e.g., show 5 lines vs 20 lines) without reindexing.\n4. **Duplication**: Code already exists in actual files—why store twice (and commit to git)?\n5. **Reload cost**: Every file change requires reloading ALL code snippets, not just changed relationships.\n\n**Benefits of post-query file reads**:\n1. **Always fresh**: Read current file content at query time (never stale).\n2. **Small index**: Graph stays ~5-10MB (just relationships), not 20-50MB (with code).\n3. **Fast reload**: Only reindex changed relationships, not code content.\n4. **Flexible context**: Adjust window size per query without reindexing.\n5. **Performance**: LRU cache + OS page cache = \u003c2ms per file

Warm read (LRU cache): \u003c0.1ms (memory)\n- Hot read (OS cache): ~0.5ms (kernel)\n- Typical: ~1-2ms per result (mix of cache hits/misses)\n\n**Benefits**:\n1.

Interface Implementation Inference\n\n**Challenge**: Go has implicit interface satisfaction (no explicit `implements` keyword). Must infer implementations by comparing method signatures.\n\n**Approach**: Signature-based matching with embedded interface

specs/code-graph.md (section 11)","text":"**Accuracy**:\n- ✅ **90-95% accuracy** for real-world Go code\n- ✅ Handles method name + signature matching\n- ✅ Resolves embedded interfaces correctly\n- ✅ Normalizes import paths for cross-package types\n- ⚠️ **Known limitations** (~5% edge cases):\n  - **Type aliases**: `type MyInt = int` not resolved (requires type system)\n  - **Generics**: `Processor[T any]` requires instantiation checking\n  - **Complex embedded structs**: Promoted methods from deeply nested structs\n\n**Performance**:\n- Extraction: ~100-200ms for medium codebase (tree-sitter parse + method extraction)\n- Inference: O(interfaces × structs × avg_methods) = ~10-50ms for typical projects\n- Total: **~100ms** vs 2-3s for full type checking\n\n**Storage overhead**:\n- ~50 bytes per method signature\n- Interface with 5 methods: ~250 bytes\n- 50 interfaces + 500 structs with avg 3 methods: ~150KB additional\n- **Total increase**: ~3% (5MB → 5.15MB)\n\n**Why not use go/types for perfect accuracy?** See \"Future Considerations\" section below.\n\n### Multi-Language Support\n\nEach language has different relationship semantics:\n\n**TypeScript**:\n- Structural typing (duck typing) - implicit interface satisfaction like Go\n- Optional explicit `implements` keyword (when used, easy to extract)\n- Explicit imports

Load previous code-graph.json\n2. Load previous generator-output.json (file checksums)\n3. Calculate current checksums\n4. Identify changed/deleted files\n5. Load existing graph\n6. Remove nodes/edges from changed/deleted files\n7. Re-extract graph from changed files\n8. Re-infer cross-file relationships (interface implementations)\n9. Merge preserved + new graph\n10. Write code-graph.json atomically (temp → rename)\n11. Update generator-output.json\n```\n\n### Cross-File Edges\n\n**Problem**: Edge from File A → File B. What if only A changes?\n\n**Solution**: Track edge ownership by file\n\n```go\ntype EdgeMetadata struct {\n    SourceFile string // File where edge originates\n    TargetFile string // File where target is defined (may differ)\n}\n\n// When File A changes:\n// - Remove edges where SourceFile == \"A\"\n// - Preserve edges where SourceFile != \"A\" (even if they reference symbols in A)\n\n// When File B changes:\n// - Remove edges where TargetFile == \"B\" OR SourceFile == \"B\"\n// - Re-extract may recreate some edges (if still valid)\n```\n\n**Example**:\n\n```\nFile A: func foo() { bar() }  → Edge(foo → bar, SourceFile=A, TargetFile=B)\nFile B: func bar() {}\n\nIf A changes: Remove edge, re-extract A, recreate edge if call still exists\nIf B changes: Remove edge (target changed), re-extract B, re-extract cross-file edges\n```\n\n### Embedded Interface Re-Flattening\n\n**Problem**: Interface A embeds Interface B. When B changes, A's resolved methods must be recomputed.\n\n**Solution**: Track embedding relationships and invalidate

specs/code-graph.md (section 12)","text":"**Complexity**:\n- **Best case** (code change, no signature change): 0ms (skip re-inference)\n- **Typical** (1 interface changed): 1 interface × 500 structs = ~5ms\n- **Worst case** (many changes): O(changed interfaces × all structs) = ~50-100ms\n\n**Still O(changes)**, not O(all types). File-level incremental model preserved.\n\n### Atomic Writes\n\nUse same pattern as chunk files:\n\n```go\n// Write to temp file\ntempFile := filepath.Join(graphDir, \".tmp\",

\u003c1ms | Index lookup |\n| callers (depth 1) | ~1ms | Index lookup |\n| callers (depth 5) | ~5-10ms | Multi-level traversal |\n| callees (depth 1) | ~1ms | Index lookup |\n| callees (depth 5) | ~5-10ms | Multi-level traversal |\n| dependencies | \u003c1ms | Package graph (small) |\n| dependents | \u003c1ms | Reverse index |\n| path | ~5-20ms | BFS shortest path |\n| impact | ~10-20ms | Combines multiple queries |\n\nWith context enrichment (+1-2ms per result):\n- 10 results: +10-20ms\n- 50 results: +50-100ms\n- 100 results: +100-200ms\n\n**Total typical query**: 10-50ms (graph query) + 50-100ms (context) = **60-150ms**\n\n### Memory Footprint\n\n| Component | Size |\n|-----------|------|\n| dominikbraun/graph | ~5MB (10K nodes, 50K edges) |\n| Reverse indexes | ~5MB (callers, callees, implementations) |\n| File cache (LRU) | ~50MB (last 100 files) |\n| **Total** | **~60MB** |\n\n**Scalability**:\n- 100K nodes, 500K edges → ~100MB graph + indexes\n- Still fits

\"find similar error handling patterns\"\n- **Strengths**: Understands concepts, cross-references code + docs\n- **Limitations**: Can't answer \"who calls X?\"\n\n**cortex_exact** (full-text, keyword-based):\n- **When**: \"find all uses of sync.RWMutex\", \"locate Provider interface\"\n- **Strengths**: Fast exact matches, boolean search\n- **Limitations**: No understanding of meaning or relationships\n\n**cortex_graph** (structural, graph-based):\n- **When**: \"who implements Provider?\", \"what calls this?\", \"impact of changing X?\"\n- **Strengths**: Precise structural queries, refactoring support\n- **Limitations**: Requires exact identifiers, no semantic understanding\n\n### LLM Tool Routing\n\n**Decision tree for LLM**:\n\n```\nUser query contains \"how\" or \"why\"?\n  → cortex_search (semantic understanding)\n\nUser query contains exact identifier (Provider, http.Handler)?\n  → Check if asking about relationships\n    → YES: cortex_graph (who calls, who implements, dependencies)\n    → NO: cortex_exact (find definition/usage)\n\nUser query about refactoring or impact?\n  → cortex_graph (impact analysis, call graphs)\n\nUser query about architecture or

specs/code-graph.md (section 15)","text":"## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: MVP - Core Graph Operations (Go only)\n\n**Goal**: Basic graph with immediate value\n\n**Scope**:\n- Extract function calls (local + package-level)\n- Extract package imports\n- Build graph with dominikbraun/graph\n- Implement operations: `callers`, `callees`, `dependencies`, `dependents`\n- MCP tool with basic parameters (operation, target, include_context)\n- Incremental indexing support\n\n**Exclude from MVP**:\n- Interface implementations (requires type checking)\n- Multi-language support\n- Advanced operations (`path`, `impact`)\n- Negative glob patterns\n\n**Complexity**: Medium\n**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks\n**Value**: High (enables basic refactoring queries)\n\n### Phase 2: Interface Inference \u0026 Advanced Operations\n\n**Goal**: Add Go-specific features\n\n**Scope**:\n- Interface implementation inference (heuristic method matching)\n- `implementations` operation\n- `impact` operation (combines implementations + callers)\n- `path` operation (shortest path between functions)\n- Filtering: `scope`, `exclude_patterns`\n- Response limits: `max_results`, `max_per_level`, `depth`\n\n**Complexity**: High (interface inference is tricky)\n**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks\n**Value**: Very High (unlocks \"what implements\" queries)\n\n### Phase 3: Multi-Language Support\n\n**Goal**:

rate\n3. **Documentation relationships**: Separate future spec (doc → code references)\n4. **Real-time updates**: Hot reload with debounce sufficient\n5. **Regex target matching**: High complexity for

for interface implementation detection. Here's why we don't use Go's type system (`go/types`):\n\n#### Fundamental Incompatibility with Incremental Model\n\n**Our incremental model**: File-level checksums detect changes. Only changed files are re-parsed and re-indexed. Unchanged files preserve their nodes and edges.\n\n**go/types requirement**: Package-level type checking requires loading **all dependencies** of a package to build the type graph. When a single file changes:\n\n1. Must load entire package containing the file\n2. Must load all packages that import it (transitive)\n3. Must type-check the full package graph to maintain correctness\n4. Must re-infer **all** interface implementations in affected packages\n\n**Result**: A one-file change in a core package triggers re-checking hundreds of files. File-level incremental updates become impossible—you need package-level or even module-level granularity.\n\n**Example**:\n\n```\nChange internal/embed/provider.go (defines Provider interface)\n→ Must re-check internal/embed package\n→ Must re-check internal/indexer (imports embed)\n→ Must re-check internal/mcp (imports embed)\n→ Must re-check cmd/cortex (imports all above)\n→ Total: 20+ files re-checked for 1 file change\n```\n\nWith signature-based matching: Only `provider.go` is re-parsed.

specs/code-graph.md (section 17)","text":"| Operation | Tree-sitter + Signatures | go/types |\n|-----------|-------------------------|----------|\n| Initial full index | ~200ms | ~2-3s |\n| Single file change | ~50ms | ~500ms-1s |\n| Memory overhead | +150KB (~3%) | +50-100MB (~100-200%) |\n\n**Why so slow?**\n- go/types builds full package graph (loads, parses, resolves all imports)\n- Type-checks method sets with full semantic analysis\n- Maintains internal type caches that need invalidation\n\n#### Complexity Cost\n\n**go/types dependencies**:\n\n```\ngolang.org/x/tools/go/packages\ngolang.org/x/tools/go/loader\ngolang.org/x/tools/internal/...\n```\n\n- External dependency on Go toolchain internals\n- Version compatibility concerns (Go 1.25 vs 1.26)\n- Larger binary size (~2-3MB additional)\n- More failure modes (broken go.mod, missing dependencies, version conflicts)\n\n**Tree-sitter approach**:\n- Single dependency: tree-sitter-go (already required for chunking)\n- Self-contained: No Go toolchain needed\n- Version-independent: Parses syntax, not semantics\n\n#### What We Actually Lose\n\nThe signature-based approach has **~90-95% accuracy**. The 5% edge cases:\n\n1. **Type aliases** (~2% of code):\n   ```go\n   type MyInt = int\n   interface Foo { Bar(MyInt) }\n   struct Baz {}\n   func (b Baz) Bar(int) {}  // Actually satisfies Foo, we

Promoted to A, but requires deep analysis\n   ```\n\n**Are these worth 20-30x slowdown + breaking incremental model?** No.\n\n### Signature-Based Matching is Sufficient\n\nThe approach documented in this spec achieves the right balance:\n\n**What it handles well** (90-95% of real code):\n- ✅ Standard interface implementations\n- ✅ Method signature matching (names, params, returns)\n- ✅ Embedded interfaces (flattened correctly)\n- ✅ Cross-package types (resolved via imports)\n- ✅ Pointer receivers vs value receivers\n- ✅ Variadic functions\n\n**What it misses** (~5% edge cases):\n- ⚠️ Type aliases (rare in interface contracts)\n- ⚠️ Generic type instantiation (Go 1.18+, still uncommon)\n- ⚠️ Deeply promoted methods (rare architectural pattern)\n\n**False positives**: Extremely rare. Method name + full signature match is highly specific.\n\n**False negatives**: The 5% we miss. LLM can still find these implementations via semantic search on the code context.\n\n**User experience**: If user asks \"what implements Provider?\", they get 95% of implementations instantly. For the edge cases, semantic search fills the gap.\n\n### Optional go/types Deep Validation\n\nInstead of using go/types for primary indexing, offer it as a **periodic validation tool**:\n\n```bash\n#

specs/code-graph.md (section 17)","text":"**Performance**: Doesn't matter—it's a one-time validation command, not part of hot path.\n\n**Value**: Builds confidence in signature-based approach without compromising speed/incrementality of normal indexing.\n\n### Cross-Language Calls\n\n**Use case**: Go service calls Python script via `exec.Command`\n\n**Challenge**: Requires analyzing command-line invocations, environment setup\n\n**Future**: Specialized extractors for common patterns (Go→Python, TypeScript→Python)\n\n### Documentation Relationships\n\n**Use case**: \"Find all code referenced by this design doc\"\n\n**Approach**: Parse code references in docs (`` `Provider` ``, file paths), create edges\n\n**Separate spec**: `docs-graph.md` (different relationship semantics)\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\nTrack graph query performance:\n\n```go\ntype Metrics struct {\n    QueryCount        int64\n    AvgQueryTimeMs    float64\n    CacheHitRate      float64\n    GraphSizeMB

specs/code-graph.md (section 19)","text":"## Summary\n\n**cortex_graph** provides structural code relationship queries that complement semantic and full-text search:\n\n- **Storage**: ~5-10MB JSON file with nodes/edges (no code text)\n- **Memory**: ~60MB in-memory graph with reverse indexes\n- **Performance**: \u003c10ms for most queries, \u003c150ms with context enrichment\n- **Operations**: implementations, callers, callees, dependencies, dependents, path, impact\n- **Context**: Post-query file reads inject code snippets (always fresh)\n- **Incremental**: Preserves unchanged

Response: `{\"embeddings\": [[float...], [float...]]}`\n- Embeddings are normalized (L2 norm = 1)\n\n**GET /**\n- Health check and model info\n- Returns: `{\"status\": \"ok\", \"model\": \"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\", \"dimensions\": 384, \"max_tokens\": 512}`\n\n**GET /model_info**\n- Returns model metadata\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n**PyTorch Compatibility Workaround**\n- Embedded Python environments exclude PyTorch test modules\n- Test modules are not used for inference, but is imported in PyTorch\n- Need to monkey-patch to create dummy `torch._inductor.test_operators` module\n- Must be done before any torch imports\n- Only affects imports, doesn't impact inference functionality\n\n**User notification**\n- PyTorch will download the model the first time we use it, this can take 10-30s, need to let users know\n- On startup, if the model isn't downloaded, it should notify user \n- Checks `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--BAAI--bge-small-en-v1.5/` for cached model\n- First run: Shows download message \"(First run: downloading ~130MB from HuggingFace)\"\n- Models take time to load into

specs/cortex-embed.md (section 6)","text":"## Build Process\n\n### Using Taskfile (Task Runner)\n\nAll build commands use `task`. See `Taskfile.yml` for complete task definitions.\n\n**Generate Python Dependencies**\n- Python dependencies need to be downloaded locally so they can be embedded into the go binary\n- This is a one-time process (unless deps change)\n- Dependencies are downloaded to internal/embed/server/data/{platform} - the data dir is in .gitignore\n- After dependencies are downloaded, the binaries can be built\n- The go code and the .py code can be changed and the binaries rebuilt without refetching the python deps\n\n```bash\n# For all platforms (10-20 min, ~300MB per platform)\ntask python:deps:all\n\n# For specific platform (faster for local testing)\ntask python:deps:darwin-arm64\ntask python:deps:linux-amd64\n...\n```\n\nThe generator (`internal/embed/server/generate/main.go`) supports:\n- All platforms via `go:generate` or `task python:deps:all`\n- Selective platforms via `-platforms` flag (e.g., `darwin-arm64,linux-amd64`)\n\n**Build Binaries**\n\n```bash\n# Build cortex

specs/cortex-embed.md (section 10)","text":"## Design Trade-offs\n\n**Why embed Python instead of Go ML libraries?**\n- Mature ecosystem (sentence-transformers, HuggingFace)\n- Pre-trained models readily available\n- Better inference performance than pure Go alternatives\n- Trade size (~300MB) for functionality and maintainability\n\n**Why separate binaries?**\n- cortex CLI is used as a project-specific MCP Server that uses stdio\n  - we will run at least one cortex instance per project, possibly multiple (one for each claude code session) \n- cortex-embed is a generic embed-server, any number of cortex processes can call it\n  - this means we only load the embed model once \n- cortex-indexer also needs the embed model to be running\n- cortex CLI stays small for fast `go install`\n- Easier to version and release

specs/cortex-exact.md (section 4)","text":"## Why Three Search Tools?\n\n**cortex_search** (semantic, vector-based):\n- **Strengths**: Understands concepts (\"authentication flow\"), finds similar patterns, cross-references code + docs\n- **Limitations**: Can't reliably find exact identifiers, no boolean logic\n\n**cortex_exact** (keyword, full-text):\n- **Strengths**: Finds exact matches (`sync.RWMutex`), boolean queries (`Provider AND interface`), fast\n- **Limitations**: No semantic understanding, requires knowing exact terms\n\n**cortex_graph** (structural, graph-based):\n-

specs/cortex-exact.md (section 6)","text":"## Shared Chunk Manager\n\n**See**: `specs/chunk-manager.md` for complete specification.\n\n### Summary\n\n**Problem**: Loading and deserializing chunks is expensive (~30ms for 10K chunks). Adding cortex_exact would require loading chunks twice (once for chromem, once for bleve).\n\n**Solution**: Extract chunk loading into shared ChunkManager:\n- Load chunks once → ~35ms (all files)\n- Detect changes → ~5ms (timestamp comparison)\n- Share read-only ChunkSet across all searchers\n- **Savings**: ~30ms per reload + enables incremental updates\n\n### Integration\n\n```go\n// ChunkManager defined in specs/chunk-manager.md\ntype ChunkManager struct {\n    chunksDir      string\n    current        *ChunkSet    // Read-only after creation\n    lastReloadTime time.Time\n    mu             sync.RWMutex // Protects swap only\n}\n\ntype ChunkSet struct {\n    chunks  []*ContextChunk              // All chunks\n    byID    map[string]*ContextChunk     // Fast lookup by ID\n

entire index\n- 10K chunks: ~360ms\n- 100K chunks: ~3-5s\n- Blocks queries during rebuild\n```\n\n**Incremental updates** (new approach):\n\n```\nFile changed → Load chunks → Detect changes (50 chunks) → Update only those 50\n- 10K chunks, 50 changed: ~45ms\n- 100K chunks, 500 changed: ~150ms\n- 8x faster, scales better\n```\n\n### Both Libraries Support Incremental Updates\n\n**chromem-go v0.7.0**:\n- `collection.AddDocument(doc)` - Add new document\n- `collection.Delete(id)` - Remove document\n- Uses flat HNSW index, operations are O(1) amortized\n\n**bleve v2 (Scorch)**:\n-

architecture:\n\n```\n┌──────────────────────────────────────┐\n│          Bleve Index                 │\n├──────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  Segment 1  │  Segment 2  │  Seg 3  │  ← Immutable segments\n├──────────────────────────────────────┤\n│     Background Merger                 │  ← Combines small segments\n└──────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**How updates work**:\n1. New documents → New segment created\n2. Deleted documents → Marked via bitmask (segment unchanged)\n3. Updated documents → Delete (mark) + Add (new segment)\n4. Background merger → Combines small segments into larger ones\n\n**Benefits**:\n- No full rebuild needed\n- Queries work concurrently with updates\n- Optimal batch size: 100-1000 documents\n\n### Index

`chunk_type:definitions` is faster than Go post-filtering\n- Power users can search metadata: `file_path:auth` finds all auth-related files\n- LLMs can construct complex queries: `text:handler AND

specs/cortex-exact.md (section 11)","text":"**Key changes from original spec**:\n1. **No match_type parameter**: QueryStringQuery handles all syntax (phrase, prefix, fuzzy, boolean)\n2. **No post-filtering**: Bleve native filtering via query syntax (`chunk_type:definitions`)\n3. **No ChunkManager lookup**: Retrieve stored fields directly from bleve (faster)\n4. **Simpler**: ~30 lines vs ~80 lines with post-filtering logic\n\n**Why this is better**:\n- ✅ Respects limit correctly (no filtering after search reduces result count)\n- ✅ Faster (native index filtering vs Go iteration)\n- ✅ More powerful (complex boolean expressions supported)\n- ✅ Cleaner code (single code path, no special cases)\n\n### Highlighting\n\n```go\nfunc extractHighlights(fragments map[string][]string) []string {\n    var highlights []string\n\n    // Bleve returns fragments as map[field][]snippets\n    for _, snippets := range fragments {\n        highlights = append(highlights, snippets...)\n

Contains exact identifier: ✓\n- Wants find usage: ✓\n- **Route to**: cortex_exact\n- **Reason**: Fast exact match\n\n**Query**: \"How does the mutex protect the collection?\"\n- Natural language question: ✓\n- **Route to**: cortex_search\n- **Reason**: Needs semantic understanding\n\n**Query**: \"What calls provider.Embed?\"\n- Asks about relationships: ✓\n- **Route to**: cortex_graph\n-

specs/cortex-exact.md (section 17)","text":"## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Shared Chunk Manager (MVP)\n\n**Goal**: Single chunk load, shared across searchers\n\n**Scope**:\n- Implement ChunkManager with ChunkSet\n- Modify chromem_searcher to use shared chunks\n- Implement change detection\n- Add incremental update to chromem_searcher\n\n**Complexity**: Medium\n**Timeline**: 2-3 days\n**Value**: Foundation for all incremental updates\n\n### Phase 2: Bleve Integration (Core Feature)\n\n**Goal**: Add cortex_exact tool with basic search\n\n**Scope**:\n- ExactSearcher implementation\n- Bleve index creation and management\n- Basic exact match search\n- MCP tool registration\n\n**Complexity**: Medium\n**Timeline**: 3-4 days\n**Value**: Enables keyword search\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Query Syntax\n\n**Goal**: Boolean operators, phrase search\n\n**Scope**:\n- Query string parsing for boolean logic\n- Phrase search support\n- Highlighting with `\u003cem\u003e` tags\n- Post-query filtering (chunk_types, tags)\n\n**Complexity**: Low-Medium\n**Timeline**: 2-3 days\n**Value**: Makes keyword search powerful\n\n### Phase 4: Fuzzy and Prefix Matching\n\n**Goal**: Typo tolerance and wildcards\n\n**Scope**:\n- Prefix matching (`Prov*`)\n- Fuzzy matching (Levenshtein distance)\n- Match type parameter handling\n\n**Complexity**: Low\n**Timeline**: 1-2

specs/cortex-exact.md (section 19)","text":"## Design Decisions\n\n### 1. Case Sensitivity\n\n**Decision**: Case-insensitive by default\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Users rarely care about `Provider` vs `provider`\n- Code identifiers are PascalCase/camelCase but users type lowercase\n- Standard analyzer lowercases tokens automatically\n\n**Trade-off**: Can't distinguish between different-cased identifiers (rare edge case)\n\n### 2. Highlighting Format\n\n**Decision**: Use `\u003cem\u003e` tags (standard HTML)\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Standard format across search engines\n- LLMs well-trained on XML/HTML syntax\n- Easy to parse if needed\n- Bleve default highlighter uses this\n\n**Alternative considered**: Plain text markers `**match**` (rejected: ambiguous with markdown)\n\n### 3. Boolean Operator Precedence\n\n**Decision**: Query string parser handles boolean logic, overrides match_type\n\n**Rationale**:\n- `\"Provider AND interface\"` clearly wants boolean search\n- Don't make user specify `match_type: \"boolean\"`\n- Bleve QueryStringQuery handles precedence correctly\n\n**Example**: `query: \"Provider AND interface\", match_type: \"fuzzy\"` → boolean search wins\n\n### 4. Index Scope (MVP)\n\n**Decision**: Index only `text` field, exclude metadata\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Simpler implementation\n- Metadata queries can be post-filtered (fast enough)\n- Avoids noise from metadata in search results\n- Can add metadata fields later without breaking changes\n\n**Future**: Add optional `file:`, `lang:` field queries\n\n### 5. Memory vs Disk\n\n**Decision**: In-memory index only\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Fast startup (no disk I/O)\n- Simple deployment (no index files to manage)\n- Memory is cheap (~20MB for 10K chunks)\n- Consistent with chromem-go (also

specs/cortex-exact.md (section 21)","text":"## Summary\n\n**cortex_exact** provides fast keyword search to complement semantic and structural queries:\n\n- **Library**: bleve v2 with Scorch index (segmented, incremental)\n- **Shared Chunks**: Single load via ChunkManager, shared across searchers\n- **Incremental Updates**: Both chromem-go and bleve support add/delete\n- **Performance**: ~5-25ms queries, ~45ms reload (8x faster than full rebuild)\n- **Memory**: ~80MB total (chromem + bleve + shared chunks)\n- **Query Syntax**: Boolean (AND/OR/NOT), phrase, prefix, fuzzy\n- **Integration**: Parallel reload, minimal locking, same file watcher\n\n**Value proposition**: Completes the three-tool search strategy (semantic + exact + structural), enabling LLMs to precisely find code identifiers, boolean search across codebase, and handle typos—all while maintaining fast reload times through incremental updates and shared chunk

specs/filtering-improvement.md (section 1)","text":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe current MCP server implementation performs all filtering in application code after chromem-go returns vector search results. This approach has limitations:\n\n1. **Inefficient native filtering utilization**: chromem-go supports WHERE clause filtering on metadata, but we pass `nil` for both WHERE parameters\n2. **Potential underdelivery**: When filters are restrictive, the 2x multiplier may not fetch enough matching results\n3. **Wasted computation**: Fetching and scoring results that will be filtered out

specs/filtering-improvement.md (section 2)","text":"## Proposed Solution: Hybrid Filtering\n\nCombine chromem-go's native WHERE filtering with post-filtering for complex criteria:\n\n1. **Native filtering**: Use chromem WHERE clause for first tag and chunk_type\n2. **Post-filtering**: Handle additional tags (AND logic), multiple chunk_types, min_score\n3. **Early exit**: Stop post-filtering once we reach the requested limit\n4. **Structured metadata**: Store tags as `tag_0`, `tag_1`, `tag_2` for direct WHERE access\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **Better targeting**: chromem returns results that

  - Multiple tags → `{\"tag_0\": \"go\"}` (others post-filtered)\n   - Single chunk_type → `{\"chunk_type\": \"symbols\"}`\n   - Combined → `{\"chunk_type\": \"symbols\", \"tag_0\": \"go\"}`\n\n2. **convertAndFilterResults()**: Verify post-filtering logic\n   - Multiple chunk_types correctly filtered\n   - Additional tags (tag_1, tag_2) correctly filtered with AND logic\n   - Early exit when limit reached\n   - MinScore filtering still works\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Query with single tag**: Verify native WHERE used, no post-filtering\n2. **Query with multiple tags**: Verify first tag in WHERE, rest post-filtered\n3. **Query with restrictive filters**: Verify result count reaches limit (no underdelivery)\n4. **Query with no filters**: Verify pure vector similarity search\n\n###

// Native WHERE\n}\n// chromem returns only docs tagged \"architecture\"\n// No post-filtering needed (only one value per filter)\n```\n\n### Scenario 2: Multi-Tag Code Search\n\n**Query**: \"error handling patterns\"\n**Filters**: `tags=[\"go\", \"code\", \"error-handling\"]`\n\n**Execution**:\n```go\nwhereFilter = {\n    \"tag_0\": \"go\",  // Native WHERE\n}\n// chromem returns Go-tagged results\n// Post-filter checks for \"code\" AND \"error-handling\" tags\n```\n\n### Scenario 3: Multiple Chunk Types\n\n**Query**: \"authentication implementation\"\n**Filters**:

specs/hybrid-incremental-indexing.md (section 1)","text":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe current incremental indexing implementation has a critical performance bottleneck: it reads **all discovered files** to calculate SHA-256 checksums, even for files that haven't changed.\n\n**Current behavior** (internal/indexer/impl.go:209-230):\n```go\n// IndexIncremental processes only changed files based on checksums.\nfunc (idx *indexer) IndexIncremental(ctx context.Context) (*ProcessingStats, error) {\n    // Discover all files\n    codeFiles, docFiles, err := idx.discovery.DiscoverFiles()\n\n    // Calculate checksums for ALL files (SLOW - reads every file)\n    for _, file := range append(codeFiles, docFiles...) {\n        relPath, _ := filepath.Rel(idx.config.RootDir, file)\n\n        newChecksum, err := calculateChecksum(file)  // os.ReadFile() + SHA-256\n        if err != nil {\n            log.Printf(\"Warning: failed to calculate checksum for %s: %v\\n\", file, err)\n            continue\n        }\n\n        newChecksums[relPath] = newChecksum\n\n        oldChecksum := metadata.FileChecksums[relPath]\n        if oldChecksum != newChecksum {\n

specs/hybrid-incremental-indexing.md (section 2)","text":"## Proposed Solution: Hybrid Two-Stage Filtering\n\nCombine fast modification time checking with accurate checksum verification:\n\n### Stage 1: Fast mtime filter (stat calls only)\n- Use `os.Stat()` to get file modification time (fast - no content read)\n- Compare `file.ModTime()` against `metadata.GeneratedAt`\n- Skip files where `mtime \u003c= lastIndexTime` (definitely unchanged)\n\n### Stage 2: Checksum verification (content reads)\n- Only for files that passed Stage 1 (potential changes)\n- Calculate SHA-256 checksum via `os.ReadFile()`\n- Compare against stored checksum\n- Catches edge cases: backdated mtimes, content-identical changes\n\n### Benefits\n\n1. **Performance**: Only read files that might have changed\n   - 10K files, 50 changed: 10K stats (~5ms) + 50 reads (~50ms) = ~55ms vs ~2000ms\n   - 40x faster for typical incremental scenarios\n\n2. **Accuracy**: Checksums catch rare edge cases mtime filtering

Discover files: ~100ms (file system traversal)\n2. Read ALL 10,000 files: ~2000ms (os.ReadFile + SHA-256)\n3. Compare checksums: ~1ms\n4. Process 50 changed files: ~500ms\n---\nTotal: ~2600ms\n```\n\n### After: Hybrid Approach\n\n```\nFor 10,000 files (50 changed):\n1. Discover files: ~100ms (file system traversal)\n2. Stat ALL 10,000 files: ~5ms (fast - no content reads)\n3. Read ONLY 50 changed files: ~10ms (os.ReadFile + SHA-256)\n4. Compare checksums for 50: ~0.1ms\n5.

Backdated mtime\n**Scenario**: User sets old modification time on a changed file\n```bash\ntouch -t 202001010000 changed_file.go\n```\n**Behavior**: Stage 1 (mtime) thinks unchanged, Stage 2 (checksum) detects change ✓\n\n### 2. mtime precision issues\n**Scenario**: Filesystem rounds mtime to seconds, file changed within same second\n**Behavior**: Stage 2 checksum verification catches the change ✓\n\n### 3. Old metadata format\n**Scenario**: User upgrades from version without FileMtimes\n**Behavior**: Falls back to checksum-only verification for first run, populates mtimes for future ✓\n\n### 4. Clock skew\n**Scenario**: System clock set backwards between runs\n**Behavior**: All mtimes appear \"future\", triggers checksum verification ✓\n\n### 5.

`GeneratorMetadata`\n\n2. **internal/indexer/impl.go**\n   - Add `shouldReprocessFile()` function with two-stage logic\n   - Update `IndexIncremental()` to use new function\n   - Update `Index()` to populate FileMtimes in metadata\n   - Handle nil FileMtimes for backward compatibility\n\n3. **internal/indexer/writer.go** (if needed)\n   - Ensure JSON marshaling handles new FileMtimes field\n\n### Migration Path\n\n1. **v2.0.0 → v2.1.0**: Add FileMtimes field, maintain backward compatibility\n2. **First incremental run after upgrade**: Populates FileMtimes, falls back to full checksum verification\n3. **Subsequent runs**: Full hybrid optimization

Symbols (High-Level Overview)\n\n**Purpose**: Quick navigation and file structure understanding\n\n**Content**:\n- Package/module name\n- Import count (not full list)\n- Type/class names with line numbers\n- Function/method names with line numbers\n\n**Format** (natural language text):\n\n```\nPackage: server\n\nImports: 5 packages\n\nTypes:\n  - Handler (struct) (lines 10-15)\n  - Config (struct) (lines 20-25)\n\nFunctions:\n  - NewHandler() (lines 30-45)\n  - (Handler) ServeHTTP() (lines 50-75)\n```\n\n**Chunk ID**: `code-symbols-{file-path}`\n\n### 2. Definitions (Full Signatures)\n\n**Purpose**: Understanding types, interfaces, and function contracts\n\n**Content**:\n- Complete type definitions with fields\n- Interface definitions\n- Function signatures (no implementation bodies)\n- Comments and docstrings\n\n**Format** (actual code with line comments):\n\n```go\n// Lines 10-15\ntype Handler struct {\n    router *http.ServeMux\n    config *Config\n}\n\n// Lines 30\nfunc NewHandler(config *Config) (*Handler, error) { ... }\n```\n\n**Chunk ID**: `code-definitions-{file-path}`\n\n### 3. Data (Constants \u0026 Configuration)\n\n**Purpose**: Finding configuration values and defaults\n\n**Content**:\n- Constant declarations\n- Global variables with initializers\n- Enum values\n- Default

(level 2) as primary boundaries\n2. **Size check**: If section \u003c target size, create single chunk\n3. **Paragraph splitting**: If section \u003e target size, split by paragraphs (double newline)\n4. **Code block preservation**: Never split inside ` ```code blocks``` `\n5. **Line tracking**: Track start_line and end_line for every chunk\n\n### Chunk Metadata\n\n- `section_index`:

specs/indexer.md (section 9)","text":"## Embedding Provider Interface\n\n**Design**: Indexer uses a provider interface to support multiple embedding backends.\n\n```go\n// Interface in internal/embed/provider.go\ntype Provider interface {\n    Embed(ctx context.Context, texts []string, mode EmbedMode) ([][]float32, error)\n    Dimensions() int\n    Close() error\n}\n\ntype EmbedMode string\nconst (\n    EmbedModeQuery   EmbedMode = \"query\"   // For search queries\n    EmbedModePassage EmbedMode = \"passage\" // For document chunks\n)\n```\n\n**Usage in Indexer**:\n```go\n// Create provider via factory\nprovider, err := embed.NewProvider(embed.Config{\n    Provider:   \"local\",\n    BinaryPath: \"cortex-embed\",\n})\n\n// Generate embeddings for document chunks (use passage mode)\nembeddings, err := provider.Embed(ctx, chunkTexts, embed.EmbedModePassage)\n```\n\n**Implementations**:\n- `LocalProvider` - Manages cortex-embed binary, auto-starts if needed\n- Future: `OpenAIProvider`, `AnthropicProvider`\n\n**Configuration** (`.cortex/config.yml`):\n```yaml\nembedding:\n  provider: \"local\"  # Currently only \"local\" supported\n  model:

File\n\n`.cortex/generator-output.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"generated_at\": \"2025-10-16T12:40:00Z\",\n  \"file_checksums\": {\n    \"README.md\": \"a1b2c3d4...\",\n

380,\n    \"processing_time_seconds\": 12.5\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Incremental Behavior\n\n1. Load previous metadata\n2. Calculate checksums for all files\n3. Compare against previous run\n4. Reprocess only changed files\n5. Merge with unchanged chunks (see algorithm below)\n6. Update metadata with new checksums\n\n### Chunk Merge Algorithm\n\n**Goal**: Preserve chunks from unchanged files, replace chunks from changed/deleted files.\n\n```\n1. Load existing chunks from .cortex/chunks/*.json\n2. Build index: file_path → [chunk_ids]\n3. For each changed file:\n   a. Remove all chunks where metadata.file_path matches\n   b. Add new chunks for changed file\n4. For each deleted file:\n   a. Remove all chunks where metadata.file_path matches\n5. Write merged chunks to output files (atomic)\n6.

Must prevent reading partial/corrupted state.\n\n**Solution**: Atomic file writes using temp → rename pattern (POSIX atomic operation).\n\n### Write Algorithm\n\n```\nFor each chunk file:\n1. Marshal chunks to JSON\n2. Write to .cortex/chunks/.tmp/\u003cfilename\u003e.json\n3. Rename to .cortex/chunks/\u003cfilename\u003e.json (atomic)\n4. On error: delete temp file, preserve old file\n```\n\n### Benefits\n\n- **MCP server safety**: Never reads incomplete files\n- **Crash recovery**: Old files preserved if write fails\n- **Hot reload

Load configuration from `.cortex/config.yml`\n2. Read chunk files from `.cortex/chunks/`\n3. Initialize chromem-go database\n4. Create vector collection with 384 dimensions\n5. Add all chunks to collection (with embeddings)\n6. **Start file watcher** on `.cortex/chunks/` directory\n7. Start MCP server on stdio\n8. Ready for queries\n\n### Query Execution\n\n1. Receive MCP tool call: `cortex_search`\n2. Validate request parameters\n3. Generate query embedding via cortex-embed\n4. Execute vector similarity search in chromem-go\n5. Apply filters (chunk_types, tags)\n6. Sort by combined_score (descending)\n7. Limit results\n8. Return MCP response\n\n### Hot Reload (New Feature)\n\n**Motivation**: `cortex index --watch` keeps chunks up-to-date, MCP server should automatically reload without restart.\n\n**Behavior**:\n1. Watch `.cortex/chunks/` directory using `fsnotify`\n2. Detect file modifications (WRITE, CREATE events)\n3. **Debounce**: Wait 500ms after last event (indexer writes multiple files)\n4. On debounce timeout:\n   - Read all chunk files\n   - Rebuild chromem-go collection (atomic swap)\n   - Log reload completion\n5.

specs/mcp-server.md (section 9)","text":"## Search Algorithm\n\n### Vector Similarity\n\nUses cosine similarity on 384-dimensional embeddings:\n\n```\nsimilarity = dot(query_embedding, chunk_embedding) / (||query|| * ||chunk||)\n```\n\nScores range from -1.0 to 1.0, higher is better.\n\n### Filtering Strategy\n\n1. **Vector search**: Fetch top N candidates (N = limit * 2 for headroom)\n2. **Chunk type filter**: Keep only matching chunk_types (if specified)\n3. **Tag filter**: Keep only chunks with ALL specified tags (AND logic)\n4. **Sort**: Order by combined_score descending\n5. **Limit**: Return top K results (K = limit)\n\n### Why 2x Multiplier\n\nFetching 2x results before filtering ensures we have enough matches after post-filtering. Example:\n- User requests `limit: 10`\n- Server fetches top 20 from vector search\n- Applies filters (might reduce to 8-15 results)\n- Returns up to 10 final results","embedding":[-0.08875342,-0.025937194,-0.052164476,0.0021056202,0.041098375,-0.03880593,-0.03633254,0.0048338347,0.046686754,0.03648352,0.020886954,-0.040316567,0.047356885,0.043622337,0.04317999,-0.017297423,0.017310992,0.014531096,0.045455754,-0.048653346,0.005107297,0.023714125,-0.0010775642,-0.07502302,-0.0066674175,0.015272942,-0.007567043,-0.074931085,-0.0021499791,-0.24172999,0.008710545,-0.04552816,0.105701186,0.00032845198,-0.020795833,0.0057027037,-0.0128998235,0.04186503,-0.062298898,-0.0023272396,0.019515129,-0.010545153,-0.05350563,-0.03454817,-0.01763639,0.053524517,-0.044837818,-0.012167867,-0.03928687,0.02248822,-0.02860136,-0.066355065,-0.005830597,0.055910055,0.044201467,0.052125037,0.007688081,0.06273672,-0.043067157,0.033377785,0.03182377,-0.023080949,-0.08715736,0.052653022,0.0045907837,0.01331427,-0.039760225,-0.025953997,0.021213759,0.08749373,0.025271202,0.07928106,-0.03147292,0.052377265,-0.037431967,0.06510965,-0.005329076,0.015555324,-0.002065881,-0.0014865682,-0.043167345,-0.012243919,0.033801984,-0.0022816663,-0.028395854,0.018243162,0.010675766,-0.0018371277,0.0134333195,-0.04542121,0.0011746482,-0.007347177,-0.03370978,0.011016439,-0.051808152,0.00019664475,0.038193945,0.0238942,0.032936733,0.36553484,0.0323889,0.051495586,0.021401094,-0.056657556,0.00410788,-0.026263006,-0.013841788,0.0016351495,-0.007930665,-0.021501575,-0.018629797,-0.047423728,0.051922616,-0.033066764,-0.006637392,0.008023738,0.052925397,0.038223185,0.026815541,-0.025493722,-0.07451578,-0.014027114,0.025456438,0.0047496473,0.0030614808,0.028026834,0.010056192,0.017239813,0.02128287,0.031715885,0.010228859,0.024690162,-0.120458916,0.005012208,-0.009766814,0.03870484,0.00038984744,-0.0060943267,-0.04758787,-0.005981491,-0.044927415,0.02658155,0.051019594,-0.04118551,-0.07070161,0.1466343,-0.042698864,-0.04393215,-0.04359379,-0.086790204,-0.006981306,0.0063491147,-0.003767056,-0.039852183,-0.035136152,0.04824858,0.03765577,0.01199202,-0.06342078,-0.030165909,0.0014311605,-0.009946037,-0.014576931,0.09046832,0.020613724,-0.07931537,-0.014343974,0.029825816,-0.030669503,-0.00543635,0.0031939223,-0.02418788,-0.03298694,0.04182458,-0.0065412475,-0.015640082,-0.114840694,-0.0034612897,0.056191936,0.016946161,0.037141725,-0.014698449,-0.011372037,0.039468516,-0.030506887,-0.018351007,0.015143203,0.021429041,0.03139805,0.018628748,-0.031121137,-0.069739245,-0.0063285152,0.008407696,-0.0018775011,-0.017238414,0.036187526,-0.009575721,0.024478933,-0.007624649,0.067158975,0.018970435,-0.007486902,0.035057843,-0.02419215,0.00062388065,-0.0037929362,-0.058047656,0.01767321,0.038072105,-0.000102842176,-0.056842297,-0.070952676,0.010472426,-0.007769085,-0.031479374,0.0053557646,0.065751895,-0.003674467,0.08188514,-0.01967516,-0.068341024,-0.05530857,-0.26542884,-0.044836603,-0.061240815,0.008983837,0.01494594,-0.06328622,-0.00045762715,-0.0037824174,0.0153783625,0.09056039,0.034574665,0.022609962,-0.030954713,-0.00045720395,-0.0018994147,0.02869935,0.018331181,0.03171878,-0.023286853,-0.065761924,0.02885208,0.02232068,0.05847694,-0.04675821,0.032140315,-0.053782314,0.13509414,0.030829698,0.011928893,-0.0361398,0.011555596,0.021337759,-0.05151958,-0.021009352,0.011602668,-0.005067846,0.014475507,0.02205691,0.02678139,-0.0055624493,-0.059000205,-0.0054012407,0.025388101,-0.05477437,-0.04765279,-0.0006292101,-0.02439615,0.023030158,-0.0035233018,0.052204303,0.010184443,0.055799026,0.033428397,-0.006870678,-0.014658654,-0.04519562,-0.03224059,-0.05102743,-0.022260856,0.018195545,-0.012326103,-0.096657194,-0.01336744,-0.024780255,0.024435524,-0.021207983,0.056896187,0.005669522,0.00029503135,0.036520053,-0.06513128,0.034064375,-0.06636375,0.04982085,0.018278668,-0.0002467543,0.015766982,-0.010677169,0.024719005,-0.002744177,0.073491976,0.04320284,0.031529807,-0.021699889,0.036745407,0.007030236,0.072112866,0.008208492,0.03763523,0.059987005,0.006627284,-0.016309243,-0.029174862,-0.02633565,0.0016711719,0.02210862,-0.28510508,0.04709944,0.0075363754,0.054108534,-0.010695203,-0.015578774,0.04345723,-0.1141168,0.035964243,-0.0054055345,-0.016461596,0.07629658,0.055065468,-0.010583942,-0.011912936,0.024276443,0.032008387,-0.034764327,0.019884,0.0340414,-0.014096491,-0.0007609898,0.20849162,-0.116791464,0.0010785778,-0.033102993,0.00021460484,-0.038197305,-0.0046641883,0.01687569,-0.012685331,-0.022576816,0.10219312,-0.0016676825,-0.0072929217,0.08002368,0.025319992,0.02221972,0.04425752,-0.062036585,0.04317161,0.010321877,-0.037919354,0.07174565,0.03149429,0.020150349,0.06310958,-0.013220224,-0.051783696,-0.04442533,-0.01349187,-0.045784697,0.008057353,-0.014739792,0.013771363,0.09984179,-0.07322004,-0.01027279,-0.0074224076,-0.0057983845,0.06528455,-0.01111701,0.030963313,0.03420379,0.029603288],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":0,"end_line":345,"file_path":"specs/mcp-server.md","section_index":9,"source":"markdown","start_line":318,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"created_at":"2025

uses same provider interface as indexer for consistency.\n\n```go\n// Interface in internal/embed/provider.go\ntype Provider interface {\n    Embed(ctx context.Context, texts []string, mode EmbedMode) ([][]float32, error)\n    Dimensions() int\n    Close() error\n}\n\ntype EmbedMode string\nconst (\n    EmbedModeQuery   EmbedMode = \"query\"   // For search queries\n    EmbedModePassage EmbedMode = \"passage\" // For document chunks\n)\n```\n\n**Usage in MCP Server**:\n\n```go\n// Create provider via factory\nprovider, err := embed.NewProvider(embed.Config{\n    Provider:   \"local\",\n    BinaryPath: \"cortex-embed\",\n})\n\n// Generate query embedding (use query mode)\nqueryEmbedding, err := provider.Embed(ctx, []string{query}, embed.EmbedModeQuery)\n```\n\n**Implementations**:\n- `LocalProvider` - Manages cortex-embed binary, auto-starts if needed\n- Future: `OpenAIProvider`, `AnthropicProvider`\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Clean abstraction - no HTTP/JSON details in MCP code\n- Same interface as indexer\n- Mode parameter ensures correct embedding type (query for searches)","embedding":[-0.058732025,-0.024358533,-0.0015212555,-0.007812602,-0.018635517,-0.010231117,-0.013561381,-0.01786764,-0.01420828,-0.016055483,0.02196096,-0.06644957,0.02903058,0.023232767,0.061982173,0.021621024,-0.06808453,0.026329625,0.05713333,-0.016061174,0.091968745,-0.011809239,-0.025258958,-0.03861327,-0.032735653,0.039285418,-0.0049661547,-0.07280036,-0.00684996,-0.20774609,0.020912059,-0.017029263,-0.0068356283,0.035321254,-0.049842007,-0.025738413,0.0013782828,0.0022389488,0.03562201,0.058780804,0.014816315,-0.015953165,0.00728856,-0.008806429,0.04730172,-0.03135373,0.03480617,-0.035927504,0.006986034,-0.004708424,0.0036965723,0.023285767,-0.02554824,0.025196435,0.014183668,0.04498883,0.024491522,0.06361148,-0.014569914,0.0054797754,0.051257275,0.035549928,-0.10506885,0.047865413,0.010908271,0.049928054,-0.014789313,0.006684458,-0.037936,0.00019027488,-0.019979347,0.0072940225,-0.015540787,0.039129306,0.014772766,-0.037200153,0.050296195,0.04291221,0.019850453,-0.010794344,-0.0044709295,0.040607058,0.021000404,-0.0424303,-0.022669414,-0.0008358877,-0.03531892,-0.0024763057,-0.0071971505,-0.0066126436,-0.054820284,-0.038420815,-0.008696114,-0.046102013,-0.050993912,0.04524134,0.012751703,0.03048974,-0.022928791,0.37299,-0.025107736,0.04161829,-0.008269198,0.008440003,0.027976518,-0.018811759,0.018861825,0.047442753,0.013195495,0.0044404897,-0.072186686,-0.015815066,0.039617956,-0.03683512,-0.0463723,-0.011148293,-0.03786512,0.060014386,-0.046451066,0.0199792,-0.0052166376,0.010437236,-0.002542791,0.064118505,0.06993114,0.005377318,-0.0055906973,0.03680932,0.036759954,0.005335876,-0.018697418,0.027222238,-0.033548605,0.043910444,0.019098924,-0.0024929873,-0.03199356,-0.022654913,0.04207027,0.00014866206,-0.020796182,0.054029446,-0.020001955,-0.021565463,-0.054799348,0.13128705,-0.051031098,0.019294813,0.011339144,-0.038407024,-0.026585968,0.04178805,-0.041917223,-0.04273292,-0.045932926,0.022952847,-0.045660414,-0.015557524,-0.08126514,-0.076228686,-0.04686287,-0.0041639726,0.03160915,0.075210646,0.018045124,-0.14086169,-0.0060913954,0.046021637,-0.043534435,-0.029477991,-0.013762702,-0.011203188,0.03038768,-0.0009137636,0.042552438,-0.009288831,-0.06774515,0.02873189,0.048902526,-0.03189995,0.01614058,0.012914038,-0.016676128,-0.01702296,-0.031122576,-0.069209665,-0.024504762,0.01916921,0.0071294503,-0.029024074,-0.04373076,0.005640692,-0.038842622,-0.00047621378,0.011171206,-0.041179538,0.005280147,0.018853191,0.03790915,-0.032331295,0.13247678,0.06098005,-0.0028124938,0.0125158,-0.07132895,-0.008308161,-0.031562235,0.008810752,-0.024509069,0.015456769,-0.040521517,0.01932026,-0.020937271,0.047677543,0.028822877,0.030124135,0.030823447,0.0140876,0.036882486,0.056108315,-0.044130445,0.0139542585,-0.04198523,-0.3075429,-0.053469043,-0.0010455927,-0.0065642605,-0.008344639,-0.093455225,0.02980889,0.038002454,-0.01507562,0.013908622,0.10671816,0.0022202122,-0.022522448,0.016145136,-0.03672395,0.038691223,0.053193342,-0.07597214,-0.030507293,0.016332792,0.06406054,0.03493771,-0.019978823,0.022150537,0.0401985,-0.015194638,0.11989197,0.0058379844,0.07680037,-0.043671183,-0.03379149,0.036145918,-0.015496296,-0.11420087,-0.022992585,-0.008930357,0.012611437,0.03879558,0.019034632,-0.022325983,-0.06747833,0.055881664,-0.016099429,-0.06588339,-0.029038249,-0.053827044,-0.010870183,-0.0011458443,-0.033585314,0.025336046,-0.07524799,-0.035086,-0.015062328,0.03621193,0.0104275495,0.0043702987,-0.02421871,-0.05264474,-0.052889384,0.033136636,0.036340665,-0.043839782,-0.014057038,-0.08413113,0.026501026,-0.01972382,0.052030418,0.052165013,0.034273766,-0.042725988,-0.03620926,0.039304435,-0.07255972,0.046942193,0.025675569,0.009930743,-0.03512183,-0.05260639,-0.029094195,-0.025546793,0.050057575,0.038875755,0.021857394,0.00030760764,0.070171446,0.010271412,0.026515538,0.027565576,0.040922377,-0.026115596,-0.0024557551,-0.056550287,-0.03623885,0.023698356,0.06013298,0.016393833,-0.3129207,0.051763292,0.02447216,0.025265649,-0.008583624,-0.0017819123,0.026787931,-0.050088055,0.0075787497,0.044173773,0.017928744,0.0015573481,0.06966732,0.02946535,0.0050215833,0.04641868,0.039050695,-0.021297615,0.012741026,-0.048697613,0.027471285,-0.011475163,0.18609431,-0.032345787,0.016810149,-0.008586356,0.057241853,0.01378604,0.052898686,0.015600406,0.07031437,-0.044954777,0.08212097,-0.0004907308,0.047835205,0.012945514,0.05062082,-0.057415005,0.017328117,-0.019482274,0.00786642,-0.009976425,-0.032673027,0.064785615,0.056509163,-0.06431789,0.008595509,-0.012020924,-0.0270299,0.006486894,-0.027647834,-0.001277139,0.027759679,-0.007288827,-0.02480392,0.037373804,-0.030442987,-0.002395198,-0.082716316,0.02124422,0.04057675,-0.004815302,0.026005257,0.075722456,0.020278595],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":1,"end_line":465,"file_path":"specs/mcp-server.md","section_index":10,"source":"markdown","start_line":405,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"created_at":"2025-10-28T22:06:13.3674

`mcp.go`) duplicate binary detection/download logic\n2. **MCP Server Broken**: `mcp.go` hardcodes `BinaryPath: \"cortex-embed\"` without checking if it exists or downloading it\n3. **Inconsistent

Design Philosophy\n\n**Provider Responsibility**: Each provider knows how to prepare itself\n- **LocalProvider**: Detect/download binary, start process, wait for health check\n- **OpenAIProvider**

Add `Initialize()` to Provider interface in `provider.go`\n2. Implement `Initialize()` in `local.go`:\n   - Call `EnsureBinaryInstalled()`\n   - Move process startup from `Embed()` to `Initialize()`\n   - Add `waitForHealthy()` method\n3. Update `newLocalProvider()` to remove BinaryPath parameter\n4. Add `Initialize()` to `mock.go` (no-op)\n\n### Phase 2: Factory Simplification\n1. Remove `BinaryPath` from `Config` struct in `factory.go`\n2. Remove binary existence validation in `NewProvider()`\n3. Update factory to just create provider instances\n\n### Phase 3: CLI Updates\n1. Update `index.go`:\n   - Remove binary detection logic (lines 94-132)\n   - Add `Initialize()` call after creating provider\n2. Update `mcp.go`:\n   - Remove hardcoded BinaryPath\n   - Add `Initialize()` call after creating provider\n\n### Phase 4: Testing\n1. Update existing provider tests to call `Initialize()`\n2.

Single Responsibility\nEach provider manages its own lifecycle:\n- LocalProvider: Binary, process, health\n- Future OpenAIProvider: API key, connectivity\n- MockProvider: Nothing (always ready)\n\n### 2. CLI Simplification\nBoth commands use identical 5-line pattern:\n```go\nprovider, err := embed.NewProvider(config)\nif err := provider.Initialize(ctx); err != nil { ... }\ndefer provider.Close()\n// Use provider\n```\n\n### 3. Fixes MCP Bug\nMCP server will now:\n- Detect missing binary\n- Download if needed\n- Start server\n- Wait for healthy\n- Start successfully ✅\n\n### 4. Extensibility\nAdding new providers is straightforward:\n```go\ntype openAIProvider struct { ... }\n\nfunc (p *openAIProvider) Initialize(ctx context.Context) error {\n    // Validate API key\n    // Check connectivity\n    return nil\n}\n```","embedding":[-0.09575483,-0.020269645,0.015907528,0.00092729874,0.014347383,-0.013501376,0.052742567,0.048607197,-0.017168626,-0.011717016,0.02321303,-0.06642251,0.011298342,0.020368718,0.026857609,-0.021340163,-0.047731325,-0.052010085,0.01645332,-0.03810401,0.0035499346,-0.033292193,-0.012962485,-0.017737336,-0.023641825,0.054466948,-0.037122842,-0.04532586,0.0029885443,-0.17751071,-0.019463556,0.0026214197,-0.02369198,-0.013003912,-0.104490064,0.02079776,0.033936314,0.01841191,0.0014477931,-0.023033474,0.052728254,0.032067448,0.021753749,-0.016869128,0.047729168,-0.051558323,0.037546948,-0.025583994,-0.032047175,0.009411114,0.02033722,0.0058913524,-0.01775205,0.0066075004,0.022568993,-0.0029322759,0.035251394,0.07865978,-0.037616033,0.0017906363,-0.0022664086,0.026250156,-0.0962015,0.07365329,-0.027661433,0.04665741,-0.03321874,0.022544747,-0.0120914895,0.018613711,-0.019440338,0.0067748437,0.03434236,0.014354703,0.0131086605,-0.031428654,0.01436018,0.035191994,0.03439947,0.03486096,0.031387314,0.021034691,0.03949933,-0.019796778,-0.007044657,0.00083210005,-0.022690916,-0.034688625,0.013811091,-0.04285402,-0.047924686,-0.0016135335,0.02891081,-0.03722285,-0.035474215,0.05153284,0.022863133,0.009556221,-0.07706925,0.395129,-0.007436619,-0.0007745441,-0.009750363,0.0019799788,0.0055616954,-0.022855874,-0.021903923,0.013937185,0.0033574735,0.023862924,-0.0256054,0.019109864,0.013808523,-0.018964892,-0.059492268,0.014223767,-0.035660394,0.030589893,0.006907049,0.021979198,0.024686279,-0.018880771,0.052544873,0.06704035,0.0012284686,-0.0011387729,0.028894974,0.034709018,-0.034171134,0.0011474577,0.04510977,0.006061276,-0.032804858,0.066740595,0.03682914,-0.017506232,-0.014623586,-0.030900326,0.013565159,0.021052964,0.021702416,0.08387297,0.0029955476,-0.078257225,-0.02423864,0.11909923,-0.0020031664,0.069318555,0.0074333637,-0.045746163,-0.0069257477,0.049522363,-0.040088136,-0.0018637497,0.013601605,0.0030988117,0.0035937398,-0.015073085,-0.06643465,-0.049891092,-0.058308784,-0.0020702875,0.022530282,0.07169534,0.01327843,-0.1758088,0.0091591915,-0.003267266,-0.05830407,0.007895658,-0.03279501,-0.001095801,0.07058868,-0.036529202,0.011442628,-0.005554557,-0.067936696,0.022008719,0.043260694,-0.011812694,-0.036067907,0.013352155,-0.00068607955,-0.03427077,-0.005419867,-0.045408886,-0.046003293,0.0027693815,-0.0053496915,-0.063572526,-0.054984104,0.002993768,-0.039753415,0.040223327,-0.013894941,-0.02740744,-0.052134886,0.008167018,0.05267788,-0.035514113,0.047598194,0.05838984,0.017197909,0.003035713,-0.06693534,-0.018639043,-0.008228542,-0.00220835,0.051703066,0.020198602,-0.047366537,0.053903498,0.01616788,0.03520292,0.01909672,-0.013234032,0.0042807064,0.04347716,0.031776167,0.032780755,-0.013211071,0.09351273,0.0074157175,-0.29038066,-0.022937167,-0.046555553,0.015145285,0.041287858,-0.13934301,0.007906079,0.014942296,-0.017447637,0.0008397223,0.077755004,0.0051014675,-0.019704372,0.051523816,0.024812257,0.032739073,0.05887779,-0.04971597,-0.04615891,0.06793268,0.037911516,0.05993339,0.00988686,-0.05028008,0.042351015,-0.007569037,0.09744538,-0.058617212,0.07910934,0.027376318,-0.031565387,0.011752078,-0.033090886,-0.16219324,0.02644299,-0.0030891679,0.011255923,-0.016492143,0.043256775,-0.009828169,-0.029591845,0.092227854,0.00016241752,-0.07949561,-0.0493549,-0.03579201,-0.04082649,0.042436063,-0.034759585,0.00573836,-0.08153584,-0.010251765,-0.024459925,-0.017521387,0.05422384,-0.037050173,-0.018730573,0.04872103,-0.044624288,0.02732712,0.004907328,-0.010951335,0.036898036,-0.044098515,0.05105148,-0.044823237,0.048349857,-0.017169762,0.016557408,-0.032016348,-0.023391195,0.04983708,-0.0714128,0.0188769,0.017973043,0.0066644102,-0.0007716936,-0.089450754,-0.0067220475,-0.00826718,0.039561026,0.01271192,-0.023767903,0.05244395,0.004826951,0.015948432,0.010705867,0.051289324,-0.0098925335,-0.013376413,-0.025500001,-0.0088786455,-0.008273516,0.0028964814,0.04788597,0.0048563294,-0.30012846,0.02816816,-0.014382026,-0.0030888526,-0.023241153,0.04469693,-0.004612445,-0.042358387,-0.03342042,0.019510772,0.055982303,0.046344537,0.051148895,0.023381315,0.011124468,0.053105403,0.03220988,-0.028872402,-0.02165145,-0.04745085,0.0077345194,0.0020578986,0.18351659,-0.035979245,0.024378514,0.017327007,0.043667704,0.051165625,0.036642335,0.0002472885,0.0650082,-0.04476058,0.018042674,-0.01348339,0.0675973,0.026751729,0.000016212703,-0.05478944,-0.05994205,0.0055785095,-0.027166083,-0.012176021,-0.0023330539,0.034290873,0.03912081,-0.060404338,-0.014561623,-0.010578512,-0.025192501,0.00732991,-0.035504967,-0.045483604,0.05369197,-0.012335048,-0.0125168925,0.012609153,0.034398522,0.012077079,-0.07752836,0.00054796087,0.054849733,0.0054087862,0.06849709,0.10989733,-0.014008624],"tags":["documentation","markdown"],"metadata":{"chunk_index":0,"end_line":401,"file_path":"specs/provider-initialization.md","section_index":6,"source":"markdown","start_line":365,"tag_0":"documentation","tag_1":"markdown"},"created_a

*testing.T) {\n       var _ embed.Provider = (*embed.LocalProvider)(nil)\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize() Success Cases**:\n   - Binary already installed\n   - Binary downloaded successfully\n   - Server starts and becomes healthy\n\n3. **Initialize() Error Cases**:\n   - Download fails (network error)\n   - Binary won't execute (permission error)\n   - Server never becomes healthy (timeout)\n   - Context cancelled during initialization\n\n4. **Initialize() Idempotency**:\n   - Calling Initialize() twice should be safe\n   - Second call should be fast (server already running)\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Lifecycle Test**:\n   ```go\n   func TestLocalProviderFullLifecycle(t *testing.T) {\n       provider, _ := embed.NewProvider(embed.Config{Provider: \"local\"})\n\n       err := provider.Initialize(context.Background())\n       require.NoError(t, err)\n\n       embeddings, err := provider.Embed(ctx, []string{\"test\"}, embed.EmbedModeQuery)\n       require.NoError(t, err)\n       require.NotEmpty(t, embeddings)\n\n       provider.Close()\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **CLI Command Tests**:\n   - Run `cortex index` on test project\n   - Run `cortex mcp` and verify it

specs/provider-initialization.md (section 8)","text":"## Migration Path\n\n### Backward Compatibility\n\n**Not a concern** - Project is pre-release. Existing users will upgrade cleanly because:\n1. Config file doesn't change (no BinaryPath field to remove from user configs)\n2. Binary location remains `~/.cortex/bin/cortex-embed`\n3. CLI commands remain identical: `cortex index`, `cortex mcp`\n\n### Documentation Updates\n\nUpdate these files:\n- `README.md` - No changes needed (user-facing commands unchanged)\n- `specs/indexer.md` - Update code examples to show Initialize()\n- `specs/mcp-server.md` - Update code examples to show Initialize()\n- `CLAUDE.md` - Update architecture section with Initialize()

set (task build)\n    }\n\n    // Fallback: get version from module info (go install)\n    if info, ok := debug.ReadBuildInfo(); ok {\n        if info.Main.Version != \"\" \u0026\u0026 info.Main.Version != \"(devel)\" {\n            return info.Main.Version\n        }\n    }\n\n    return \"dev\"\n}\n\nfunc getGitCommit() string {\n    if GitCommit != \"none\" {\n        return GitCommit\n    }\n\n    // Fallback: get commit from build settings\n    if info, ok := debug.ReadBuildInfo(); ok {\n        for _, setting := range info.Settings {\n            if setting.Key == \"vcs.revision\" {\n                return setting.Value[:7]  // Short hash\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return \"none\"\n}\n\nfunc getBuildDate() string {\n    if BuildDate != \"unknown\"
